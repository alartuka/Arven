# Arven
A Customer Support AI Agent for [Aven's website](https://www.aven.com/)

## Why This Project?
- This project was built as my first submission for Headstarter’s BuildCore Engineer Sprint Program
- The task was to create a customer-support AI agent for Aven
- Aven's existing chatbot only redirected users to support articles and failed to resolve issues directly, resulting in friction, unresolved queries, and avoidable churn
- I treated the assignment as a chance to design a focused, resolution-driven agent and introduced a mascot to increase engagement without diluting function
- This serves as my first real RAG implementation aimed at solving an active business problem rather than a hypothetical scenario
