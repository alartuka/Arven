It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\\n\\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\\n\\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\\n\\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\\n\\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\\n\\nWhat is my monthly payment?\\n\\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\\n\\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\\n\\nCan I get cash too?\\n\\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\\n\\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\\n\\nDoes this affect my credit score?\\n\\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\\n\\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\\n\\nAre there any fees?\\n\\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don’t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\\n\\n##### More Questions...\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n# Become an Expert\\n\\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\\n\\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\\\\n\\\\\\nYes!

Card is slightly different as it’s linked to your home equity. Card basics: \\n \\n No annual fee \\n Card earns 3% back on all purchases on up to $100,000 in spend per year, then 2% unlimited cash back (must be enrolled in AutoPay) \\n 7.49 – 14.99% Var. APR \\n Cash Out (draw to bank account) fee and Balance Transfer fee is 2.5% of amount transferred \\n \\n \\n Our Verdict \\n It does say you can check your offer without a credit check so they must be doing a soft pull on your credit and then a hard pull if you go ahead and apply for the product. The 3% cash back is obviously interesting, I suspect you might also be able to get large credit limits as it’s tied to your home equity. This could help boost your FICO score.

What they haven’t historically been so good at is addressing personal finance needs as they relate to your rent or mortgage.\\n\\nRecently, though, homeowners have a specific credit card to get excited about. The Aven Home card is designed to be a cross between a rewards card and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Given the unique hybrid nature of this offer, I think it has the potential to change the way we think about credit cards, particularly among home owners.\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> Don’t feel left out, Renters! There’s a card aimed at helping you out in an all-new way as well: The [CardName](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/aven-home-card-is-it-worth-it.html) discontinued allows you to earn rewards on your rent payments without incurring any transaction or processing fees.\\n\\n## How does the Aven Home card work?\\n\\nWhen it comes to day-to-day use, the Aven card works like a regular Visa card, so you can enjoy the convenience of a credit card with the lower interest rates associated with a HELOC. It’s the underwriting and fee structure of the Aven credit card that sets it apart– basically, the card utilizes your home’s equity as a form of collateral to secure your credit line and lower rates.\\n\\nWhen you apply for the card, the issuer will verify your income and credit score/history as well as the equity in your home. Assuming you’re approved, you’ll receive the card in the mail soon after.\\n\\n> Home equity loan vs. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)\\n>\\n> How does a HELOC differ from a home equity loan? In short:\\n>\\n> - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower’s home – your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable.\\n> - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you’ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events – like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option.\\n\\nYour monthly minimum payments will be 1% of your principal balance, plus interest and any fees. It’s a setup that’s fairly typical for a credit card.\\n\\nWhere Aven differs is that you have the option to set up fixed monthly payments for balance transfers and cash outs. In that case, you won’t pay interest on those transactions, but you will pay a set monthly fee. A number of mainstream banks, including Chase and Citibank, offer similar payment setups for certain purchases on their qualifying cards.\\n\\n➤\\xa0LEARN MORE: [Credit card built-in fixed APR personal loans vs. traditional personal loans](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/debt/credit-card-built-in-fixed-apr-personal-loans-vs-traditional-personal-loans.html)\\n\\nIf you’re considering the Aven credit card as a balance transfer option, it’s best to not think about it as a purchase card option until that balance is paid off.\\n\\n“If you’re in credit card debt, stop using your cards \\\\[for new purchases\\\\],” advises Beverly Harzog, consumer finance analyst and author of\\xa0“The Debt Escape Plan: How to Free Yourself from Credit Card Balances, Boost Your Credit Score, and Live Debt-Free.” “Focus on becoming debt-free. This can be challenging, but as you pay down debt, your credit score will start to increase. You’ll feel a rush of adrenaline that will help you stick with it!”\\n\\n## Highlights of the Aven credit card\\n\\n- 7.99%-15.49% variable APR on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. Your initial rate is based on your\\xa0[credit score](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/vantagescore-vs-fico.html)\\n- Up to a $250,000 credit limit, which is MUCH higher than the\\xa0typical card limit of around $3,952\\n- Offers\\xa0[balance transfers](https://www.cardratings.com/balance-transfer/what-is-a-balance-transfer.html)\\xa0and cash outs (directly deposit cash from your card to your bank account, which is similar to a\\xa0[credit card cash advance](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/can-i-get-cash-back-when-i-buy-something-with-a-credit-card.html)) and you have the option of fixed rate monthly payments. Unlike other cards, you can also lock in your payments for five or 10 years. (One-time 2.5 % transfer fee applies for both transfers and cash outs).\\n- You can use funds from a cash out for any purpose and, unlike almost all other credit cards that charge a higher rate for cash advances, the cash out rate is the same as the fixed purchase rate\\n- 2% unlimited cash back on all purchases\\n- Potentially lower fees than a traditional HELOC and a more streamlined, faster application and approval process\\n\\n## Details of the Aven Home card\\n\\n### Rewards\\n\\nAven cardholders earn 2% cash back on every purchases, which is on par with other flat-rate cash-back cards and higher than the base rate of many tiered rate cash-back cards.\\n\\nRewards, however, aren’t terribly flexible. You can redeem your cash back for statement credit, which could save you a bit of money but won’t allow you to strategically maximize the rewards as you can with some points/cash-back cards.\\n\\n### Card fees\\n\\n**Annual fee:** The Aven card offers a $0 annual fee option for all applicants.\\n\\n**Balance transfer fee:** There’s a 2.5% fee for balance transfers, which is higher than the typical fee. If you REALLY need a lengthy period of time (say, more than 18 months) to pay off a chunk of debt, it _might_ be worth it. That said, there are plenty of balance transfer credit cards out there that offer a 0% APR period (15-18 months isn’t hard to find for people with excellent credit) and a fee of 3%. Taken together, that could prove a much better option for most people.\\n\\n**Cash advance fee:** Again, there’s a 2.5% cash advance fee BUT cash advances enjoy the same interest rate as purchases, which is highly unusual. With most cards, you’ll pay a higher interest rate for cash advances than for purchases and balance transfers.\\n\\n**Loan origination fees:** There’s aren’t any! This is where the card shines for people considering a HELOC. In many cases, a HELOC has some origination and processing fees to get your started; but you pay any of that with the Aven card.\\n\\n**APR:** The card advertises that you get “really, really low rates”. While I don’t totally agree with the phrase “really, really low rates,” this card does offer a purchase rate as low as 7.99% (not an\\xa0[introductory or teaser rate](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/0-apr/best-practices-saving-with-an-intro-0-apr-card.html)). In comparison, the national average is around 20%\\xa0[according to NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/credit-card-interest-rates-hit-record-high-rcna56373).\\n\\n“Compared to other credit cards, most of which now have high double digit rates, this is a good deal,” notes Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, author of the New York Times bestseller “Zero Debt: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Freedom” and affectionately known as the\\xa0[Money Coach](https://themoneycoach.net/).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> If you take out a traditional HELOC and use it exclusively for home improvements, the interest on that loan is tax deductible. Talk with a tax adviser about the deductibility of projects completed using your Aven card.\\n\\n## Are there any potential ‘gotchas’ with the Aven card?\\n\\nThe Aven credit card is definitely more complicated than the average card, but really only as it relates to how you qualify and what kind of payment structure you’re anticipating. While this alone isn’t a big cause for concern, there are other potential issues worth discussing.\\n\\n**1)**\\xa0There’s no question that Aven card has attractive rates and a unique value proposition, but the real question is who exactly this offer is best suited for. Obviously, getting a HELOC is not a light decision, particularly since you could lose your house if you get too far behind in payments (since the HELOC is secured by your home)!\\n\\n“Aven has excellent rates because they use your home as collateral, which can be risky,” explains Harzog. “So, think carefully about using the Aven card over, say, an unsecured card with rewards.”\\n\\nKhalfani-Cox points out this card could be a smart choice for applicants who “are financially disciplined and pay their card balances in a timely manner.”\\n\\n**2)**\\xa0Related to point #1, the BIG red flag on this offer is the very real prospect of overspending due to potentially having a large\\xa0[credit line](https://www.cardratings.com/what-factors-determine-the-credit-limit-you-get-on-a-credit-card.html) of up to $250,000 (depending on your credit score and how much equity you have in your house).\\n\\nWhile you might have this same issue if you got a traditional HELOC (one not attached to a card), using this card with a much larger than normal credit line may be extra tempting and cause some consumers to blow their\\xa0[monthly budget](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/should-you-take-a-charging-break.html).\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nIf you think you lack the self restraint required to manage this line of credit — and \\\\[would be\\\\] tempted to utilize your home equity excessively or for unwise purchases — do yourself a favor and avoid the possibility of maxing out this card, and potentially putting both your credit rating and your home at risk.\\n\\n— Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, The Money Coach\\n\\n**3)** While it’s nice to be able to pay off other cards and debts with a fixed monthly payment using the cash-out feature, this feature may not be the best option when considering that [the best 0% balance transfer offers can last up to 21 months](https://www.cardratings.com/best-balance-transfer-credit-cards.html)\\xa0(assuming you can pay off the 0% transfer within the introductory time frame).\\n\\nThe key takeaway here is why pay a low interest rate, when you can potentially pay no interest!\\n\\n“This is an interesting offer and it has some benefits if you have good credit and qualify for a low interest rate,” Harzog explains. “If you have debt on high-interest credit cards, you can do a balance transfer so you can pay your balance off at a lower rate.”\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nBut if you have card debt and still have a very good credit score, it’s better to \\\\[do a normal\\\\] balance transfer and get a 0% rate for a period of time.\\n\\n— Beverly Harzog, Consumer Finance Analyst\\n\\n## Does Aven offer a competitive rewards program?\\n\\nThe short answer is that Aven does offer competitive rebates, but it’s not the “best of breed” when compared to other cash-back offers. If you really like the 2% unlimited cash back benefit on all purchases, you should be aware that there are “normal” rebate cards that offer [2% cash back on purchases (or more) with no annual fees](https://www.cardratings.com/best-credit-cards-for-cash-back-rewards.html#card3387).\\n\\nIf you are trying to pay down debt, that extra .5% (or more) on some purchases could help you out.\\n\\n“Paying down debt could make my earnings go further rather than just using my cash back to buy stuff off Amazon like I’ve done in the past,” notes Scott Bonge, the founder of\\xa0[MyPerfectGoatee.com](https://www.myperfectgoatee.com/), and a long-term rewards credit card user.\\n\\n“It’s really a matter of personal preference, money-management style and existing credit resources,” Khalfani-Cox adds. “Someone who doesn’t need a HELOC, perhaps because they already have one or don’t want to draw down on that line, may be better off with a traditional 2% cash back card.\\n\\n“But for someone who prefers lower rates (ongoing, not intro.) and/or having the flexibility that a HELOC-type card provides, the Aven card may be more beneficial.”\\n\\nThe bottom line is that while Aven has a decent rewards program, you shouldn’t apply for this offer solely based on it’s rewards program. The rebates should be viewed simply as an added bonus (pun intended).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> As is the case with other reward cards, you can not earn rebates on balance transfers and cash outs. The redemption options for Aven are limited as cash-back rebates are only redeemable as a statement credit (you can’t get gift cards, a check in the mail, etc).\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nThe Aven Home card has introduced a creative way for homeowners to conveniently take advantage of their equity. I love their hybrid approach and I do believe this offer can definitely be a blessing to a certain demographic, particularly when considering the economic environment we find ourselves in.\\n\\nI also love the balance transfer and cash out feature, but would caution current and potential cardholders to remember a few “old school” debt reduction principles when using this new card to consolidate and/or pay down debt.\\n\\n“In general, I recommend people prioritize paying off their debts organically — meaning they use cash to pay it off, not another form of borrowing,” Khalfani-Cox elaborates. “There’s a difference between a ‘zero debt'”‘ strategy — which seeks to eliminate debt progressively — and a ‘shift debt’ strategy, which really just pushes the debt around from one form of credit or borrowing to another.\\n\\n_“_ Because I once had a ton of credit card debt before paying it off, I do understand the ‘shift debt’ strategy,” Khalfani-Cox conitinues. “It’s the same strategy, in effect, that people have used (myself included) when they do balance transfers. You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a ‘shift debt’ strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it’s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt. Ultimately, you do have to pay the piper and pay off what you owe.”\\n\\nUltimately, as Khalfani-Cox reminded me in a recent interview, it pays to have a set of rules for when you will use credit. Ask yourself: under what circumstances and for what types of purchases will I use this card or this form of credit — and then stick to that. By setting up some pre-established guidelines and criteria for credit usage, you’ll become a lot better at managing credit wisely and avoiding the pitfall of excessive credit use.\\n\\nI sincerely hope these insider tips are helpful to you and would love your feedback on your personal experiences with the Aven card, balance transfers and card debt. Who knows, I may include feedback from you in a future article.

The [Aven Visa Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) is an innovative financial solution that rewards you with a lower cost of capital for having built equity in your home.\\n\\nThis card can be right for homeowners with some borrowing or spending needs. It isn\\'t for everyone, but if used correctly, it can potentially make sense for you.\\n\\n## What is the Aven Home Credit Card?\\n\\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\\n\\nAVEN\\n\\nThe [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) combines a credit card and a home equity line of credit, or HELOC. It uses the equity in your home to give you a flexible credit line for purchases. Not to mention, it comes with low variable interest rates starting at 7.49%.\\\\* Plus, the card starts at a $0 fee to get the card\\\\*. That includes no origination fee, no annual fee and no appraisal, notary or prepayment penalty fees, though a county recording fee may apply.\\\\*\\n\\nIt is a rewards card that earns you 2% unlimited cash back on every transaction you make with the card and 7% cash back on all hotel bookings through the Aven Travel Portal.\\\\* Aven states that you\\'ll find all the same hotels and airlines available on other online travel agencies, including Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and other luxury chains.\\n\\nAven says that it approves new customers quickly with lines up to $250,000 with flexible repayment options. Borrowers can also request cash advances or balance transfers, though a 2.5% fee\\\\* on these types of transactions should factor into your decision-making.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that this sort of approach to leveraging the equity in your home does have some risks and drawbacks.\\n\\nThe variable APR and the 2.5% fee on cash out and balance transfers\\\\* could impact your total cost of credit. Aven does offer fixed APR plans for cashouts and balance transfers as well with 5-year or 10-year term options.\\\\* HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) carry the risk of a lien on your home but lower your interest burden, whereas personal credit cards generally won\\'t result in foreclosure on your home if you\\'re unable to pay your debt but carry much higher interest rates that might result in bankruptcy. Aven is aware of people\\'s potential concerns about foreclosure and recently introduced a guaranteed foreclosure protection program for eligible cardholders.\\\\*\\n\\n## Easy application process, quick approval\\n\\nWhere Aven truly shines over traditional HELOC processes is the ease of applying and the time it takes to approve and open your account. Customers can get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\\n\\nThis card is a home equity line of credit, even if it functions similarly to a credit card. That means you\\'ll need to own a home and have the title in your name. You\\'ll also need a credit score of at least 640, a combined loan-to-value ratio of under 89% (inclusive of the Aven line), and sufficient income to repay the loan.\\n\\n![](https://thepointsguy.com/images/EmailSignUp/daily-dt.svg)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n\\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\\n\\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\\n\\nEmail address\\n\\nSign up\\n\\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://thepointsguy.com/terms-of-use/) and acknowledge the data practices in our [Privacy Policy](https://thepointsguy.com/privacy-policy/).

(Each borrower should consult a tax professional to understand their individual tax circumstances.)\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n- A larger line of credit may lead to overspending on purchases. Aven does verify income levels to ensure borrowers can afford payments.\\n- Any line of credit secured by your home opens you up to the risk of foreclosure. Aven says that it works with borrowers to minimize this risk. Aven also offers optional debt protection plans in partnership with Securian Financial, at no profit to Aven, that protect enrolled borrowers for up to $50,000 of outstanding balances in the event of involuntary job loss. However, traditional personal credit cards don\\'t generally result in defaults on your primary home, even if you end up in a situation where you cannot keep up with the amount owed, but can lead to other challenges with higher interest rates (bankruptcy, etc.).\\n- There\\'s a 2.5% fee for cash transfer and balance transfer options\\\\*, which can add to your cost of credit in a meaningful way.\\n- If the value of your home falls, it\\'s possible that you could owe more than your home is worth. That could create problems if you try to sell your home in the future.\\n\\n## Bottom line\\n\\nThe [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) represents a unique way to leverage the equity in your home to finance major purchases such as home renovations, medical, major purchases, and education expenses. With a quick and easy application process, Aven can make it easier to have a credit line available for large purchases that you want to pay for over time. And Aven\\'s rates can be much lower than traditional credit card rates if you intend to carry a balance.\\n\\nHowever, there are unique risks and things to consider with a HELOC vs. a traditional credit card, so weigh the pros and cons accordingly.\\n\\nIt\\'s wise to consider whether a credit line that\\'s backed by the equity in your home is the right choice for your financial needs. If you determine the Aven Home Card is the right choice for you, the [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) is certainly an interesting option to consider.\\n\\n**Learn more: [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D)**\\n\\n_\\\\*For full terms and conditions, visit [aven.com](http://www.aven.com/#disclosures)._\\n\\n_Aven cards are arranged by Aven Financial, Inc., dba \"Aven\" or \"AvenCard\" (in AR, ID, and PA).

Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven\\'s control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\\n\\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant\\'s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\\n\\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\\n\\n- Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.\\n\\nAven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account – it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\\n\\nTo transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\\n\\n\\n##### Payments\\n\\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\\n\\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan\\'s minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\\n\\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\\n\\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\\n\\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\\n\\n\\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\\n\\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\\n\\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\\n\\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\\n\\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\\xa0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

Aven offers multiple hardship services to cardholders who struggle with their payments. Please note that an account may be blocked if no payment is received by the time the next statement is issued.\\n\\n- Can I pay with a check? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven cardholders can use the Aven Card app to easily connect their bank account using their routing and account number to make a payment. They can also use their existing online banking platforms to make payments to Aven. [https://my.aven.com/](https://my.aven.com/)\\n\\n- Can I add or remove bank accounts for Auto pay or bill pay? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nCardholders can add or remove bank accounts in the Aven Card app or online at [https://my.aven.com/card](https://my.aven.com/card)\\n\\n- Does a purchase refund count against the minimum payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nWhile a refunded purchase will reduce a customer\\'s remaining statement balance, it will not count towards the minimum due payment - with one exception:\\n\\nif there is only one purchase during the cycle, and this purchase is refunded to bring the statement balance to zero, there will be no minimum payment for that cycle.\\n\\n\\nSHOW MORE\\n\\n##### Before You Apply\\n\\n- What are the eligibility criteria for applying for Aven? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant\\'s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.

Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\\n\\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product?

Available as both a physical and digital card, the card now brings the full power of crypto usage to millions of people worldwide with a single tap or swipe.\\n\\n### Empowering Financial Freedom with Crypto\\n\\nFor millions in LATAM and other underbanked regions globally, accessing traditional financial services can be challenging due to high fees, inflation, and limited infrastructure. The Avalanche Card lowers these barriers by providing users with an easier way to directly convert and use digital assets.\\n\\n> “With the Avalanche Card, your cryptocurrency becomes a tool for empowerment,” says John Wu, President of Ava Labs. “As digital assets gain mainstream adoption, it’s critical to showcase real-world use cases that feel as familiar as swiping a credit card.”\\n\\nThrough its integration with Visa’s trusted global network, users can now pay for groceries, transportation, online shopping, and even utility bills, as applicable—just like any traditional credit card, but with crypto.\\n\\n### Bridging the Gap Between Decentralized Finance and Real World Usage\\n\\nThe Avalanche Card supports Avalanche-native USDC, USDT, AVAX, and Wrapped AVAX (wAVAX) at launch, with plans to expand to more assets in the future. Built on Rain’s advanced infrastructure, the card seamlessly bridges the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world utility, unlocking new use cases for crypto holders.\\n\\n### Avalanche Card’s Impact in Emerging Markets\\n\\nThe [World Bank](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/07/why-financial-inclusion-is-the-key-to-a-thriving-digital-economy/#:~:text=The%20World%20Bank%20estimates%20that,in%20the%20global%20financial%20landscape.) estimates that as of July 2024, 1.4 billion adults worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to essential financial services. This financial exclusion is particularly evident in Latin America, Nigeria, and Southeast Asia, where traditional banking barriers continue to limit economic opportunities.\\n\\nIn Latin America, as of 2023,\\xa0 [70% of the population remains unbanked](https://www.token-city.com/resources/cryptocurrency-and-tokenization-adoption-the-digital-frontier-in-latin-america) due to high interest rates and limited access to dollar-based savings. With double-digit interest rates, persistent inflation, and frequent currency devaluation, many in the region are turning to digital assets as a more stable store of value, [fueling a 40% growth in crypto adoption](https://www.token-city.com/resources/cryptocurrency-and-tokenization-adoption-the-digital-frontier-in-latin-america).\\n\\nIn Nigeria, [which ranks as the second highest country for cryptocurrency adoption globally](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/subsaharan-africa-crypto-adoption-2024) as of June 2024, banking limitations, currency instability, and restrictions on foreign exchange access have led millions to rely on crypto for daily transactions and wealth preservation. Digital assets offer an alternative to traditional finance, bypassing the inefficiencies of cash-based economies.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Southeast Asia, where the economy has rapidly evolved over the past decade, [six in ten people remain underbanked or unbanked](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/02/closing-southeast-asia-s-financial-inclusion-gap/) as of February 2022. Limited access to financial services prevents millions from participating fully in the digital economy, making crypto-powered solutions like the Avalanche Card can be a crucial tool for financial inclusion.\\n\\nBy potentially eliminating the need for an intermediary, the Avalanche Card provides a viable alternative for millions in regions that account for a significant share of global crypto activity, helping individuals gain access to secure, borderless financial solutions.\\n\\n### Availability & ETHDenver Activation\\n\\nTo celebrate the launch, Avalanche will activate the Avalanche Card at ETHDenver, allowing early adopters to experience its capabilities firsthand. ETHDenver attendees will be among the first to sign up and receive a physical card.\\n\\nThe Avalanche Card is now open for sign-ups. Users can join the waitlist today to be among the first to experience a new era of crypto-powered financial access.\\n\\n➡️ Sign up here: [https://www.avalanchecard.com](https://www.avalanchecard.com)\\n\\n_Neither Avalanche, the Avalanche card or any cryptocurrency is FDIC insured.

Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven\\'s control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\\n\\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant\\'s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\\n\\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\\n\\n- Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.\\n\\nAven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account – it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\\n\\nTo transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\\n\\n\\n##### Payments\\n\\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\\n\\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan\\'s minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\\n\\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\\n\\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\\n\\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\\n\\n\\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\\n\\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\\n\\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\\n\\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\\n\\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\\xa0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail. [https://my.aven.com/](https://my.aven.com/)\\n\\n\\n\\n[iframe](https://player.vimeo.com/video/736684158?h=a3de1222cd&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479)\\n\\n- Do missed payments impact a customer\\'s home? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nOne or two late payments will not put a cardholders home at risk or in default. Aven offers multiple hardship services to cardholders who struggle with their payments. Please note that an account may be blocked if no payment is received by the time the next statement is issued.\\n\\n- Can I pay with a check? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven cardholders can use the Aven Card app to easily connect their bank account using their routing and account number to make a payment. They can also use their existing online banking platforms to make payments to Aven. [https://my.aven.com/](https://my.aven.com/)\\n\\n- Can I add or remove bank accounts for Auto pay or bill pay? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nCardholders can add or remove bank accounts in the Aven Card app or online at [https://my.aven.com/card](https://my.aven.com/card)\\n\\n- Does a purchase refund count against the minimum payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nWhile a refunded purchase will reduce a customer\\'s remaining statement balance, it will not count towards the minimum due payment - with one exception:\\n\\nif there is only one purchase during the cycle, and this purchase is refunded to bring the statement balance to zero, there will be no minimum payment for that cycle.\\n\\n\\nSHOW MORE\\n\\n##### Before You Apply\\n\\n- What are the eligibility criteria for applying for Aven? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant\\'s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations. Meeting the minimum criteria does not guarantee an approval. All signers (applicants and/or co-owners) must be at least 18 years of age or older. All signers must possess valid government issued identification documents specified by Aven. For lines above $100,000, borrowers need to provide proof of insurance and proof of adding Aven/Coastal Community Bank as a beneficiary on the policy.\\n\\n- How do you verify income? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven can verify income by securely connecting an applicant\\'s bank account, or reviewing uploaded documents including Form 1040, a pay stub, W2, 1099-R, 1099-SSA, 1099-B, retirement income, benefit income. Aven\\'s online application will specify the types of documents to upload.\\n\\n- Will applying affect or impact my credit score? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nWhen you apply for an Aven card, we perform a “soft pull” on your credit in order to determine an offer. This does NOT impact the applicant\\'s credit score. You can check your offer without your credit score being affected.\\n\\nOnly after you accept an offer and schedule a time with our notaries will we make a hard inquiry on your credit profile. This may impact the credit score.\\n\\n- Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card.

This POA is only used for correcting minor typographical or grammatical errors, misspellings, or clerical errors. It specifically prohibits changes to rates, amounts.\\n\\n- How do notary sessions work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThe Aven Card is a Home Equity Line of Credit and requires document signing with a notary. Notary sessions are conducted fully online. All signers will have their own signing session. The signer needs to have their original, unexpired government issued photo ID, a mobile phone with a working video camera, microphone, and high speed internet.\\n\\n- Who needs to sign the agreements? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAll applicants need to sign the Account Agreement, Deed of Trust, Power of Attorney, and notice of right to cancel. All property owners and spouses need to sign the deed of trust and notice of right to cancel as a non-borrowing signer, applicable in all states as per Aven policy. Aven does not accept POAs for signatures, except for active duty personnel who are deployed overseas with a military POA.\\n\\n- My ID has expired. What can I do to complete the notarization process? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nTo complete the notary session, applicants need to have their original, unexpired identification document, such as Driver\\'s License, Passport Book, Passport Card, etc. If an ID is expired or damaged, the applicant must obtain a valid ID before the notary session.\\n\\n- How long does someone have to complete the notarization after applying? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nApplicants have 30 calendar days from beginning the application to accept an offer, if given. In addition, applicants have 30 calendar days from accepting their offer to completing the notarization session.\\n\\n- How can someone complete a notary session if an additional signer is not available at the same time or is in a different place? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThis is not an issue. Aven\\'s notary system can easily schedule two separate notary appointments.\\n\\n\\nSHOW MORE\\n\\n##### Debt Protection\\n\\n- Does Aven make any money from Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nNo, Aven does not make any money from this product. We offer it solely to provide our customers with peace of mind when using their home equity. The costs charged are passed directly through from Securian Financial, who serves as our contractual liability policy partner and our plan administrator.\\n\\n- I have a joint account. What happens if only one of us loses their job while we are enrolled in Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIf either of the co-borrowers experiences involuntary unemployment, the account will be covered for the coverage listed above.\\n\\n- What happens if I don’t pay the Debt Protection fee? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIf you don’t pay your Debt Protection fees, the loan addendum will be considered lapsed and you will not be eligible to file a claim in the event of involuntary unemployment. Even if you are not able to pay your minimum monthly payment for Aven, as long as you pay your Debt Protection fees, you will be eligible to file a claim.\\n\\n- Can I appeal a claim decision for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThere is no option to appeal at this time. Securian\\'s claim decision is final.\\n\\n- Do I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nNo. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent. However, you will need to remit the Debt Protection fees owed in order to process the claim. The cardholder has active coverage if the protection has not lapsed. Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current.\\n\\n- Are there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nDebt protection is not possible in the following cases:\\n\\n\\n- A customer retires, quits, or resigns\\n- A claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance\\n- A claim occurs on or after 70th birthday\\n\\n- How do I file a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nEmail us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application.\\n\\nThere you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation.\\n\\nOnce a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.\\n\\n- How are Debt Protection fees calculated? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThe monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.\\n\\n- How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\\n\\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower’s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\\n\\n\\n\\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\\n\\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIn order to qualify, you must:\\n\\n\\n- Be under 70 years old\\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\\n- Not be self-employed\\n\\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.\\n\\n\\nSHOW MORE\\n\\n##### Can\\'t find what you need?\\n\\nSearch question, keywords, or

Available as both a physical and digital card, the card now brings the full power of crypto usage to millions of people worldwide with a single tap or swipe.\\n\\n### Empowering Financial Freedom with Crypto\\n\\nFor millions in LATAM and other underbanked regions globally, accessing traditional financial services can be challenging due to high fees, inflation, and limited infrastructure. The Avalanche Card lowers these barriers by providing users with an easier way to directly convert and use digital assets.\\n\\n> “With the Avalanche Card, your cryptocurrency becomes a tool for empowerment,” says John Wu, President of Ava Labs. “As digital assets gain mainstream adoption, it’s critical to showcase real-world use cases that feel as familiar as swiping a credit card.”\\n\\nThrough its integration with Visa’s trusted global network, users can now pay for groceries, transportation, online shopping, and even utility bills, as applicable—just like any traditional credit card, but with crypto.\\n\\n### Bridging the Gap Between Decentralized Finance and Real World Usage\\n\\nThe Avalanche Card supports Avalanche-native USDC, USDT, AVAX, and Wrapped AVAX (wAVAX) at launch, with plans to expand to more assets in the future. Built on Rain’s advanced infrastructure, the card seamlessly bridges the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world utility, unlocking new use cases for crypto holders.\\n\\n### Avalanche Card’s Impact in Emerging Markets\\n\\nThe [World Bank](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/07/why-financial-inclusion-is-the-key-to-a-thriving-digital-economy/#:~:text=The%20World%20Bank%20estimates%20that,in%20the%20global%20financial%20landscape.) estimates that as of July 2024, 1.4 billion adults worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to essential financial services. This financial exclusion is particularly evident in Latin America, Nigeria, and Southeast Asia, where traditional banking barriers continue to limit economic opportunities.\\n\\nIn Latin America, as of 2023,\\xa0 [70% of the population remains unbanked](https://www.token-city.com/resources/cryptocurrency-and-tokenization-adoption-the-digital-frontier-in-latin-america) due to high interest rates and limited access to dollar-based savings. With double-digit interest rates, persistent inflation, and frequent currency devaluation, many in the region are turning to digital assets as a more stable store of value, [fueling a 40% growth in crypto adoption](https://www.token-city.com/resources/cryptocurrency-and-tokenization-adoption-the-digital-frontier-in-latin-america).\\n\\nIn Nigeria, [which ranks as the second highest country for cryptocurrency adoption globally](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/subsaharan-africa-crypto-adoption-2024) as of June 2024, banking limitations, currency instability, and restrictions on foreign exchange access have led millions to rely on crypto for daily transactions and wealth preservation. Digital assets offer an alternative to traditional finance, bypassing the inefficiencies of cash-based economies.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Southeast Asia, where the economy has rapidly evolved over the past decade, [six in ten people remain underbanked or unbanked](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/02/closing-southeast-asia-s-financial-inclusion-gap/) as of February 2022. Limited access to financial services prevents millions from participating fully in the digital economy, making crypto-powered solutions like the Avalanche Card can be a crucial tool for financial inclusion.\\n\\nBy potentially eliminating the need for an intermediary, the Avalanche Card provides a viable alternative for millions in regions that account for a significant share of global crypto activity, helping individuals gain access to secure, borderless financial solutions.\\n\\n### Availability & ETHDenver Activation\\n\\nTo celebrate the launch, Avalanche will activate the Avalanche Card at ETHDenver, allowing early adopters to experience its capabilities firsthand. ETHDenver attendees will be among the first to sign up and receive a physical card.\\n\\nThe Avalanche Card is now open for sign-ups. Users can join the waitlist today to be among the first to experience a new era of crypto-powered financial access.\\n\\n➡️ Sign up here: [https://www.avalanchecard.com](https://www.avalanchecard.com)\\n\\n_Neither Avalanche, the Avalanche card or any cryptocurrency is FDIC insured.

Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven\\'s control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\\n\\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant\\'s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\\n\\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\\n\\n- Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.\\n\\nAven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account – it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\\n\\nTo transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\\n\\n\\n##### Payments\\n\\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\\n\\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan\\'s minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\\n\\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\\n\\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\\n\\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\\n\\n\\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\\n\\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\\n\\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\\n\\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\\n\\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\\xa0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

For cards with lines above $100,000, if the draw in the first 90 days is less than $50,000, Aven may reduce the line size to the amount outstanding, plus $25,000.\\n\\n- Which Index do you use? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\n\\n\\nFor variable rate loans, Aven uses two different Indicies. Your Cardholder agreement will specify the Index used for your account.\\n\\n\\n\\nWall Street Journal Prime (WSJ Prime): The Wall Street Journal surveys some of the country\\'s biggest banks and publishes a consensus rate based on the survey. This is one of the most common indicies used for many lending products. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates). https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates\\n\\n\\n\\nFederal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL): This rate is set by the Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve (FOMC). It is the short-term interest rate at which U.S. Banks and Credit Unions lend to each other overnight within the Federal Reserve system. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM). [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rate on your account is the sum of the index and the margin. Both can be found in your Account Agreement.\\n\\n- Do you give a HUD-1? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\n\\n\\nThere is no HUD-1 form associated with the Aven Home Card.

Cardholders can find their current rates in the Aven App (under \"Account Details\").\\xa0 The effective APR for each billing cycle is also printed in the statement..\\n\\n- Is the rate variable? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThe Aven Card is a variable rate credit card. Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven\\'s control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\\n\\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant\\'s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\\n\\n- Is Aven a simple interest loan or does it have an amortization schedule? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven offers several balance plans and some of them use the simple interest method of interest calculation.\\n\\nFor revolving balances, Aven uses the Average Daily Balance method of interest calculation. For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle. We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle. Cardholders can find the rate used for the cycle on their statement in the \"Plan Summary\" section towards the end.\\n\\nFor fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. (Some Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment fixed rate Installment plans for 5, 10, 15, or 30 years. Please check your account agreement to see if you have these plans.)\\n\\nFor payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator)\\n\\n- How can someone get a lower rate compared to the offered? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated,\\xa0 offers based on applicants’ income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.

Please look at your account agreement for which the Index is used in your account. The maximum APR is 18%. The latest WSJ Prime Rate and FFTR-UL Rate can be found on the public internet at the Wall Street Journal webpage, or the Federal Reserve webpage.\\n\\n- Are there any origination or annual fees? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThe Aven Card comes without application fees, annual fees, or account closing fees. Select offers for some customers might include first-draw fees, clearly indicated at the time of the offer.\\n\\n- Would the effective interest rate stay the same for fixed monthly payment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThe effective interest rate may vary for fixed monthly payment plans.

Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\\n\\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower’s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\\n\\n\\n\\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\\n\\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIn order to qualify, you must:\\n\\n\\n- Be under 70 years old\\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\\n- Not be self-employed\\n\\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.\\n\\n\\nSHOW MORE\\n\\n##### Can\\'t find what you need?\\n\\nSearch question, keywords, or

What they haven’t historically been so good at is addressing personal finance needs as they relate to your rent or mortgage.\\n\\nRecently, though, homeowners have a specific credit card to get excited about. The Aven Home card is designed to be a cross between a rewards card and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Given the unique hybrid nature of this offer, I think it has the potential to change the way we think about credit cards, particularly among home owners.\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> Don’t feel left out, Renters! There’s a card aimed at helping you out in an all-new way as well: The [CardName](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/aven-home-card-is-it-worth-it.html) discontinued allows you to earn rewards on your rent payments without incurring any transaction or processing fees.\\n\\n## How does the Aven Home card work?\\n\\nWhen it comes to day-to-day use, the Aven card works like a regular Visa card, so you can enjoy the convenience of a credit card with the lower interest rates associated with a HELOC. It’s the underwriting and fee structure of the Aven credit card that sets it apart– basically, the card utilizes your home’s equity as a form of collateral to secure your credit line and lower rates.\\n\\nWhen you apply for the card, the issuer will verify your income and credit score/history as well as the equity in your home. Assuming you’re approved, you’ll receive the card in the mail soon after.\\n\\n> Home equity loan vs. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)\\n>\\n> How does a HELOC differ from a home equity loan? In short:\\n>\\n> - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower’s home – your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable.\\n> - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you’ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events – like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option.\\n\\nYour monthly minimum payments will be 1% of your principal balance, plus interest and any fees. It’s a setup that’s fairly typical for a credit card.\\n\\nWhere Aven differs is that you have the option to set up fixed monthly payments for balance transfers and cash outs. In that case, you won’t pay interest on those transactions, but you will pay a set monthly fee. A number of mainstream banks, including Chase and Citibank, offer similar payment setups for certain purchases on their qualifying cards.\\n\\n➤\\xa0LEARN MORE: [Credit card built-in fixed APR personal loans vs. traditional personal loans](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/debt/credit-card-built-in-fixed-apr-personal-loans-vs-traditional-personal-loans.html)\\n\\nIf you’re considering the Aven credit card as a balance transfer option, it’s best to not think about it as a purchase card option until that balance is paid off.\\n\\n“If you’re in credit card debt, stop using your cards \\\\[for new purchases\\\\],” advises Beverly Harzog, consumer finance analyst and author of\\xa0“The Debt Escape Plan: How to Free Yourself from Credit Card Balances, Boost Your Credit Score, and Live Debt-Free.” “Focus on becoming debt-free. This can be challenging, but as you pay down debt, your credit score will start to increase. You’ll feel a rush of adrenaline that will help you stick with it!”\\n\\n## Highlights of the Aven credit card\\n\\n- 7.99%-15.49% variable APR on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. Your initial rate is based on your\\xa0[credit score](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/vantagescore-vs-fico.html)\\n- Up to a $250,000 credit limit, which is MUCH higher than the\\xa0typical card limit of around $3,952\\n- Offers\\xa0[balance transfers](https://www.cardratings.com/balance-transfer/what-is-a-balance-transfer.html)\\xa0and cash outs (directly deposit cash from your card to your bank account, which is similar to a\\xa0[credit card cash advance](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/can-i-get-cash-back-when-i-buy-something-with-a-credit-card.html)) and you have the option of fixed rate monthly payments. Unlike other cards, you can also lock in your payments for five or 10 years. (One-time 2.5 % transfer fee applies for both transfers and cash outs).\\n- You can use funds from a cash out for any purpose and, unlike almost all other credit cards that charge a higher rate for cash advances, the cash out rate is the same as the fixed purchase rate\\n- 2% unlimited cash back on all purchases\\n- Potentially lower fees than a traditional HELOC and a more streamlined, faster application and approval process\\n\\n## Details of the Aven Home card\\n\\n### Rewards\\n\\nAven cardholders earn 2% cash back on every purchases, which is on par with other flat-rate cash-back cards and higher than the base rate of many tiered rate cash-back cards.\\n\\nRewards, however, aren’t terribly flexible. You can redeem your cash back for statement credit, which could save you a bit of money but won’t allow you to strategically maximize the rewards as you can with some points/cash-back cards.\\n\\n### Card fees\\n\\n**Annual fee:** The Aven card offers a $0 annual fee option for all applicants.\\n\\n**Balance transfer fee:** There’s a 2.5% fee for balance transfers, which is higher than the typical fee. If you REALLY need a lengthy period of time (say, more than 18 months) to pay off a chunk of debt, it _might_ be worth it. That said, there are plenty of balance transfer credit cards out there that offer a 0% APR period (15-18 months isn’t hard to find for people with excellent credit) and a fee of 3%. Taken together, that could prove a much better option for most people.\\n\\n**Cash advance fee:** Again, there’s a 2.5% cash advance fee BUT cash advances enjoy the same interest rate as purchases, which is highly unusual. With most cards, you’ll pay a higher interest rate for cash advances than for purchases and balance transfers.\\n\\n**Loan origination fees:** There’s aren’t any! This is where the card shines for people considering a HELOC. In many cases, a HELOC has some origination and processing fees to get your started; but you pay any of that with the Aven card.\\n\\n**APR:** The card advertises that you get “really, really low rates”. While I don’t totally agree with the phrase “really, really low rates,” this card does offer a purchase rate as low as 7.99% (not an\\xa0[introductory or teaser rate](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/0-apr/best-practices-saving-with-an-intro-0-apr-card.html)). In comparison, the national average is around 20%\\xa0[according to NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/credit-card-interest-rates-hit-record-high-rcna56373).\\n\\n“Compared to other credit cards, most of which now have high double digit rates, this is a good deal,” notes Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, author of the New York Times bestseller “Zero Debt: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Freedom” and affectionately known as the\\xa0[Money Coach](https://themoneycoach.net/).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> If you take out a traditional HELOC and use it exclusively for home improvements, the interest on that loan is tax deductible. Talk with a tax adviser about the deductibility of projects completed using your Aven card.\\n\\n## Are there any potential ‘gotchas’ with the Aven card?\\n\\nThe Aven credit card is definitely more complicated than the average card, but really only as it relates to how you qualify and what kind of payment structure you’re anticipating. While this alone isn’t a big cause for concern, there are other potential issues worth discussing.\\n\\n**1)**\\xa0There’s no question that Aven card has attractive rates and a unique value proposition, but the real question is who exactly this offer is best suited for. Obviously, getting a HELOC is not a light decision, particularly since you could lose your house if you get too far behind in payments (since the HELOC is secured by your home)!\\n\\n“Aven has excellent rates because they use your home as collateral, which can be risky,” explains Harzog. “So, think carefully about using the Aven card over, say, an unsecured card with rewards.”\\n\\nKhalfani-Cox points out this card could be a smart choice for applicants who “are financially disciplined and pay their card balances in a timely manner.”\\n\\n**2)**\\xa0Related to point #1, the BIG red flag on this offer is the very real prospect of overspending due to potentially having a large\\xa0[credit line](https://www.cardratings.com/what-factors-determine-the-credit-limit-you-get-on-a-credit-card.html) of up to $250,000 (depending on your credit score and how much equity you have in your house).\\n\\nWhile you might have this same issue if you got a traditional HELOC (one not attached to a card), using this card with a much larger than normal credit line may be extra tempting and cause some consumers to blow their\\xa0[monthly budget](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/should-you-take-a-charging-break.html).\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nIf you think you lack the self restraint required to manage this line of credit — and \\\\[would be\\\\] tempted to utilize your home equity excessively or for unwise purchases — do yourself a favor and avoid the possibility of maxing out this card, and potentially putting both your credit rating and your home at risk.\\n\\n— Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, The Money Coach\\n\\n**3)** While it’s nice to be able to pay off other cards and debts with a fixed monthly payment using the cash-out feature, this feature may not be the best option when considering that [the best 0% balance transfer offers can last up to 21 months](https://www.cardratings.com/best-balance-transfer-credit-cards.html)\\xa0(assuming you can pay off the 0% transfer within the introductory time frame).\\n\\nThe key takeaway here is why pay a low interest rate, when you can potentially pay no interest!\\n\\n“This is an interesting offer and it has some benefits if you have good credit and qualify for a low interest rate,” Harzog explains. “If you have debt on high-interest credit cards, you can do a balance transfer so you can pay your balance off at a lower rate.”\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nBut if you have card debt and still have a very good credit score, it’s better to \\\\[do a normal\\\\] balance transfer and get a 0% rate for a period of time.\\n\\n— Beverly Harzog, Consumer Finance Analyst\\n\\n## Does Aven offer a competitive rewards program?\\n\\nThe short answer is that Aven does offer competitive rebates, but it’s not the “best of breed” when compared to other cash-back offers. If you really like the 2% unlimited cash back benefit on all purchases, you should be aware that there are “normal” rebate cards that offer [2% cash back on purchases (or more) with no annual fees](https://www.cardratings.com/best-credit-cards-for-cash-back-rewards.html#card3387).\\n\\nIf you are trying to pay down debt, that extra .5% (or more) on some purchases could help you out.\\n\\n“Paying down debt could make my earnings go further rather than just using my cash back to buy stuff off Amazon like I’ve done in the past,” notes Scott Bonge, the founder of\\xa0[MyPerfectGoatee.com](https://www.myperfectgoatee.com/), and a long-term rewards credit card user.\\n\\n“It’s really a matter of personal preference, money-management style and existing credit resources,” Khalfani-Cox adds. “Someone who doesn’t need a HELOC, perhaps because they already have one or don’t want to draw down on that line, may be better off with a traditional 2% cash back card.\\n\\n“But for someone who prefers lower rates (ongoing, not intro.) and/or having the flexibility that a HELOC-type card provides, the Aven card may be more beneficial.”\\n\\nThe bottom line is that while Aven has a decent rewards program, you shouldn’t apply for this offer solely based on it’s rewards program. The rebates should be viewed simply as an added bonus (pun intended).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> As is the case with other reward cards, you can not earn rebates on balance transfers and cash outs. The redemption options for Aven are limited as cash-back rebates are only redeemable as a statement credit (you can’t get gift cards, a check in the mail, etc).\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nThe Aven Home card has introduced a creative way for homeowners to conveniently take advantage of their equity. I love their hybrid approach and I do believe this offer can definitely be a blessing to a certain demographic, particularly when considering the economic environment we find ourselves in.\\n\\nI also love the balance transfer and cash out feature, but would caution current and potential cardholders to remember a few “old school” debt reduction principles when using this new card to consolidate and/or pay down debt.\\n\\n“In general, I recommend people prioritize paying off their debts organically — meaning they use cash to pay it off, not another form of borrowing,” Khalfani-Cox elaborates. “There’s a difference between a ‘zero debt'”‘ strategy — which seeks to eliminate debt progressively — and a ‘shift debt’ strategy, which really just pushes the debt around from one form of credit or borrowing to another.\\n\\n_“_ Because I once had a ton of credit card debt before paying it off, I do understand the ‘shift debt’ strategy,” Khalfani-Cox conitinues. “It’s the same strategy, in effect, that people have used (myself included) when they do balance transfers. You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a ‘shift debt’ strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it’s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt. Ultimately, you do have to pay the piper and pay off what you owe.”\\n\\nUltimately, as Khalfani-Cox reminded me in a recent interview, it pays to have a set of rules for when you will use credit. Ask yourself: under what circumstances and for what types of purchases will I use this card or this form of credit — and then stick to that. By setting up some pre-established guidelines and criteria for credit usage, you’ll become a lot better at managing credit wisely and avoiding the pitfall of excessive credit use.\\n\\nI sincerely hope these insider tips are helpful to you and would love your feedback on your personal experiences with the Aven card, balance transfers and card debt. Who knows, I may include feedback from you in a future article.

Card basics: \\n \\n No annual fee \\n Card earns 3% back on all purchases on up to $100,000 in spend per year, then 2% unlimited cash back (must be enrolled in AutoPay) \\n 7.49 – 14.99% Var. APR \\n Cash Out (draw to bank account) fee and Balance Transfer fee is 2.5% of amount transferred \\n \\n \\n Our Verdict \\n It does say you can check your offer without a credit check so they must be doing a soft pull on your credit and then a hard pull if you go ahead and apply for the product. The 3% cash back is obviously interesting, I suspect you might also be able to get large credit limits as it’s tied to your home equity. This could help boost your FICO score. Could also be useful as a HELOC alternative.

The [Aven Visa Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) is an innovative financial solution that rewards you with a lower cost of capital for having built equity in your home.\\n\\nThis card can be right for homeowners with some borrowing or spending needs. It isn\\'t for everyone, but if used correctly, it can potentially make sense for you.\\n\\n## What is the Aven Home Credit Card?\\n\\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\\n\\nAVEN\\n\\nThe [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) combines a credit card and a home equity line of credit, or HELOC. It uses the equity in your home to give you a flexible credit line for purchases. Not to mention, it comes with low variable interest rates starting at 7.49%.\\\\* Plus, the card starts at a $0 fee to get the card\\\\*. That includes no origination fee, no annual fee and no appraisal, notary or prepayment penalty fees, though a county recording fee may apply.\\\\*\\n\\nIt is a rewards card that earns you 2% unlimited cash back on every transaction you make with the card and 7% cash back on all hotel bookings through the Aven Travel Portal.\\\\* Aven states that you\\'ll find all the same hotels and airlines available on other online travel agencies, including Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and other luxury chains.\\n\\nAven says that it approves new customers quickly with lines up to $250,000 with flexible repayment options. Borrowers can also request cash advances or balance transfers, though a 2.5% fee\\\\* on these types of transactions should factor into your decision-making.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that this sort of approach to leveraging the equity in your home does have some risks and drawbacks.\\n\\nThe variable APR and the 2.5% fee on cash out and balance transfers\\\\* could impact your total cost of credit. Aven does offer fixed APR plans for cashouts and balance transfers as well with 5-year or 10-year term options.\\\\* HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) carry the risk of a lien on your home but lower your interest burden, whereas personal credit cards generally won\\'t result in foreclosure on your home if you\\'re unable to pay your debt but carry much higher interest rates that might result in bankruptcy. Aven is aware of people\\'s potential concerns about foreclosure and recently introduced a guaranteed foreclosure protection program for eligible cardholders.\\\\*\\n\\n## Easy application process, quick approval\\n\\nWhere Aven truly shines over traditional HELOC processes is the ease of applying and the time it takes to approve and open your account. Customers can get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\\n\\nThis card is a home equity line of credit, even if it functions similarly to a credit card. That means you\\'ll need to own a home and have the title in your name. You\\'ll also need a credit score of at least 640, a combined loan-to-value ratio of under 89% (inclusive of the Aven line), and sufficient income to repay the loan.\\n\\n![](https://thepointsguy.com/images/EmailSignUp/daily-dt.svg)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n\\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\\n\\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\\n\\nEmail address\\n\\nSign up\\n\\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://thepointsguy.com/terms-of-use/) and acknowledge the data practices in our [Privacy Policy](https://thepointsguy.com/privacy-policy/).

(Each borrower should consult a tax professional to understand their individual tax circumstances.)\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n- A larger line of credit may lead to overspending on purchases. Aven does verify income levels to ensure borrowers can afford payments.\\n- Any line of credit secured by your home opens you up to the risk of foreclosure. Aven says that it works with borrowers to minimize this risk. Aven also offers optional debt protection plans in partnership with Securian Financial, at no profit to Aven, that protect enrolled borrowers for up to $50,000 of outstanding balances in the event of involuntary job loss. However, traditional personal credit cards don\\'t generally result in defaults on your primary home, even if you end up in a situation where you cannot keep up with the amount owed, but can lead to other challenges with higher interest rates (bankruptcy, etc.).\\n- There\\'s a 2.5% fee for cash transfer and balance transfer options\\\\*, which can add to your cost of credit in a meaningful way.\\n- If the value of your home falls, it\\'s possible that you could owe more than your home is worth. That could create problems if you try to sell your home in the future.\\n\\n## Bottom line\\n\\nThe [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) represents a unique way to leverage the equity in your home to finance major purchases such as home renovations, medical, major purchases, and education expenses. With a quick and easy application process, Aven can make it easier to have a credit line available for large purchases that you want to pay for over time. And Aven\\'s rates can be much lower than traditional credit card rates if you intend to carry a balance.\\n\\nHowever, there are unique risks and things to consider with a HELOC vs. a traditional credit card, so weigh the pros and cons accordingly.\\n\\nIt\\'s wise to consider whether a credit line that\\'s backed by the equity in your home is the right choice for your financial needs. If you determine the Aven Home Card is the right choice for you, the [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) is certainly an interesting option to consider.\\n\\n**Learn more: [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D)**\\n\\n_\\\\*For full terms and conditions, visit [aven.com](http://www.aven.com/#disclosures)._\\n\\n_Aven cards are arranged by Aven Financial, Inc., dba \"Aven\" or \"AvenCard\" (in AR, ID, and PA).

Available as both a physical and digital card, the card now brings the full power of crypto usage to millions of people worldwide with a single tap or swipe.\\n\\n### Empowering Financial Freedom with Crypto\\n\\nFor millions in LATAM and other underbanked regions globally, accessing traditional financial services can be challenging due to high fees, inflation, and limited infrastructure. The Avalanche Card lowers these barriers by providing users with an easier way to directly convert and use digital assets.\\n\\n> “With the Avalanche Card, your cryptocurrency becomes a tool for empowerment,” says John Wu, President of Ava Labs. “As digital assets gain mainstream adoption, it’s critical to showcase real-world use cases that feel as familiar as swiping a credit card.”\\n\\nThrough its integration with Visa’s trusted global network, users can now pay for groceries, transportation, online shopping, and even utility bills, as applicable—just like any traditional credit card, but with crypto.\\n\\n### Bridging the Gap Between Decentralized Finance and Real World Usage\\n\\nThe Avalanche Card supports Avalanche-native USDC, USDT, AVAX, and Wrapped AVAX (wAVAX) at launch, with plans to expand to more assets in the future. Built on Rain’s advanced infrastructure, the card seamlessly bridges the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world utility, unlocking new use cases for crypto holders.\\n\\n### Avalanche Card’s Impact in Emerging Markets\\n\\nThe [World Bank](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/07/why-financial-inclusion-is-the-key-to-a-thriving-digital-economy/#:~:text=The%20World%20Bank%20estimates%20that,in%20the%20global%20financial%20landscape.) estimates that as of July 2024, 1.4 billion adults worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to essential financial services. This financial exclusion is particularly evident in Latin America, Nigeria, and Southeast Asia, where traditional banking barriers continue to limit economic opportunities.\\n\\nIn Latin America, as of 2023,\\xa0 [70% of the population remains unbanked](https://www.token-city.com/resources/cryptocurrency-and-tokenization-adoption-the-digital-frontier-in-latin-america) due to high interest rates and limited access to dollar-based savings. With double-digit interest rates, persistent inflation, and frequent currency devaluation, many in the region are turning to digital assets as a more stable store of value, [fueling a 40% growth in crypto adoption](https://www.token-city.com/resources/cryptocurrency-and-tokenization-adoption-the-digital-frontier-in-latin-america).\\n\\nIn Nigeria, [which ranks as the second highest country for cryptocurrency adoption globally](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/subsaharan-africa-crypto-adoption-2024) as of June 2024, banking limitations, currency instability, and restrictions on foreign exchange access have led millions to rely on crypto for daily transactions and wealth preservation. Digital assets offer an alternative to traditional finance, bypassing the inefficiencies of cash-based economies.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Southeast Asia, where the economy has rapidly evolved over the past decade, [six in ten people remain underbanked or unbanked](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/02/closing-southeast-asia-s-financial-inclusion-gap/) as of February 2022. Limited access to financial services prevents millions from participating fully in the digital economy, making crypto-powered solutions like the Avalanche Card can be a crucial tool for financial inclusion.\\n\\nBy potentially eliminating the need for an intermediary, the Avalanche Card provides a viable alternative for millions in regions that account for a significant share of global crypto activity, helping individuals gain access to secure, borderless financial solutions.\\n\\n### Availability & ETHDenver Activation\\n\\nTo celebrate the launch, Avalanche will activate the Avalanche Card at ETHDenver, allowing early adopters to experience its capabilities firsthand. ETHDenver attendees will be among the first to sign up and receive a physical card.\\n\\nThe Avalanche Card is now open for sign-ups. Users can join the waitlist today to be among the first to experience a new era of crypto-powered financial access.\\n\\n➡️ Sign up here: [https://www.avalanchecard.com](https://www.avalanchecard.com)\\n\\n_Neither Avalanche, the Avalanche card or any cryptocurrency is FDIC insured.

And well, let’s just say other people aren’t so keen about accepting the idea once they pieced things out and found that either these people are creating dreams out of thin air which they couldn’t really back with actions and products, or they’ve watched too much Bladerunner and now they can’t accept a society where AI and Virtual Realms coexist.\\n\\nIn any case, it’s mostly because as I said, they make promises that are too hard to keep, some even creating bombastic features which are, while certainly exceptional, are something that the whole industry’s not necessarily requiring given the moment.\\n\\nSuddenly, In the ever-evolving landscape of metaverse and crypto technology, one name’s buzzing around that keeps the dream alive and kicking.\\n\\nHow about we talk about [Aventis Metaverse](https://aventismetaverse.com/) and what they are doing differently?\\n\\n**What’s a Metaverse Anyway?**\\n\\nAlright, let’s clear up the basics first. In case you’re living under a rock or something, Metaverse is a technologically-augmented version of the tangible world we’re living in, which is perceived virtually and accessed through special programs or hardwares.\\n\\nThe metaverse primarily promises freedom and liberty to do whatever you want without any compromise. You want to own virtual lands you could rent out to people or corporations? Sure thing! You want to be a virtual star and provide high-quality content to millions of people at the comfort of your own home? You got it boss!\\n\\nWell, the premise of liberty to create and be whatever you want to be is both a boon and a bane in the face of the public who’s asking for more. For one, this drives more people into these projects, who doesn’t want to be in a project that grants you the keys to a different world anyway?\\n\\nBut at the same time, this also acts as a ball-and-chain in their foot, as people will take their words for it and when they can’t provide what they promised to, problems arise.\\n\\n**The Aventis Difference**\\n\\nThe Aventis Metaverse, or [AVTM](https://aventismetaverse.com/) for short, is one of these digital realms, but it’s got its own unique twist. While some metaverses focus on pure escapism, AVTM aims to be a space where it’s not all just rainbows and butterflies (although frankly speaking the metaverse they’re trying to build is beautiful!), but an ecosystem where your talent can be easily paired with the proper knowledge you need.\\n\\nThey are introducing the industry’s first **Virtual Graduate School**!\\n\\n**The Pillars of AVTM**\\n\\nNow, let’s talk about the foundations that keep the whole Aventis Metaverse system up and running.\\n\\nFor starters, how about we explore how they make this “Learn-and-Earn” program happen?\\n\\n**The Aventis Learn-and-Earn**\\n\\nMoney matters, even in the digital world. AVTM knows this much, that’s why earning is a primary feature that you can pretty much enjoy at your own leisure.\\n\\nAnother important commodity in the crypto industry, arguably just as important if not even more than money, is knowledge. There’s a reason why people flock upon course programs and information campaigns like flies on honey when they come by, and of course, in typical AVTM fashion, they knew about this as well.\\n\\nWhich is why they introduced a comprehensive Graduate Education program in partnership with a “Learn-and-Earn” (L2E) mechanism which provides every active learner in the AVTM realm with rewards for feeding their brains with important life-based knowledge and disciplines!\\n\\n**The Aventis Metaverse**\\n\\nThe very heart and soul of the whole Aventis Metaverse lies in the “virtual world” that they are trying to build from the ground up. Knowing that they are composed of some of the best and well-acclaimed leaders of the crypto and tech industries, Aventis Metaverse continuously promises a platform that is accessible wherever you are courtesy of a globally-reachable Metaverse, but also a virtual realm that is future-proof.\\n\\n**The Aventis DAO**\\n\\nProjects have witnessed how great things would be if the people were given their voice. After all they’re the ones who are at the frontlines and the first to know what’s awesome and what’s flopping.\\n\\nAventis Metaverse is no different from these projects, but what they do differently is actually involve the public’s say in the foundations that build this massive enterprise!\\n\\nIntroducing AVTM DAO, where not only are the public given the voice to air out all their opinions and ideas!\\n\\n**The Aventis AI-Harness**\\n\\nAI’s the craze right now, AVTM knows that much, but how can you use it to its full potential?\\n\\nWell, in AVTM’s case, AI powers the very foundation of its systematic education program, allowing instructors to gain ease-of-access to information they wouldn’t have been able to acquire by conventional means, as well as students being offered more avenues for learning thanks to AI powering their curriculum. Isn’t that amazing?\\n\\n**What’s Next for AVTM?**\\n\\nThe Aventis team is continuously working on improving the metaverse. They’re all ears when it comes to user feedback, so you can expect to see regular updates and enhancements.\\n\\nBesides that, the AVTM peeps devised an awesome and comprehensive Roadmap that they will follow through to a T, so don’t just expect regular updates, be aware that these updates are\\n\\n**In Conclusion**\\n\\nThe Aventis Metaverse is a refreshing take on the emerging concept of the metaverse. With its user-friendly design, focus on education and empowering the newbloods of the industry, and of course, its commitment to **Accessibility, Affordability, AI, and Autonomous governance** of its system, makes it a digital space worth exploring. So, if you’ve been wondering about the metaverse, give AVTM a shot — you might just find a new digital world to call home.\\n\\nWanna learn more about Aventis Metaverse?

What they haven’t historically been so good at is addressing personal finance needs as they relate to your rent or mortgage.\\n\\nRecently, though, homeowners have a specific credit card to get excited about. The Aven Home card is designed to be a cross between a rewards card and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Given the unique hybrid nature of this offer, I think it has the potential to change the way we think about credit cards, particularly among home owners.\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> Don’t feel left out, Renters! There’s a card aimed at helping you out in an all-new way as well: The [CardName](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/aven-home-card-is-it-worth-it.html) discontinued allows you to earn rewards on your rent payments without incurring any transaction or processing fees.\\n\\n## How does the Aven Home card work?\\n\\nWhen it comes to day-to-day use, the Aven card works like a regular Visa card, so you can enjoy the convenience of a credit card with the lower interest rates associated with a HELOC. It’s the underwriting and fee structure of the Aven credit card that sets it apart– basically, the card utilizes your home’s equity as a form of collateral to secure your credit line and lower rates.\\n\\nWhen you apply for the card, the issuer will verify your income and credit score/history as well as the equity in your home. Assuming you’re approved, you’ll receive the card in the mail soon after.\\n\\n> Home equity loan vs. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)\\n>\\n> How does a HELOC differ from a home equity loan? In short:\\n>\\n> - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower’s home – your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable.\\n> - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you’ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events – like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option.\\n\\nYour monthly minimum payments will be 1% of your principal balance, plus interest and any fees. It’s a setup that’s fairly typical for a credit card.\\n\\nWhere Aven differs is that you have the option to set up fixed monthly payments for balance transfers and cash outs. In that case, you won’t pay interest on those transactions, but you will pay a set monthly fee. A number of mainstream banks, including Chase and Citibank, offer similar payment setups for certain purchases on their qualifying cards.\\n\\n➤\\xa0LEARN MORE: [Credit card built-in fixed APR personal loans vs. traditional personal loans](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/debt/credit-card-built-in-fixed-apr-personal-loans-vs-traditional-personal-loans.html)\\n\\nIf you’re considering the Aven credit card as a balance transfer option, it’s best to not think about it as a purchase card option until that balance is paid off.\\n\\n“If you’re in credit card debt, stop using your cards \\\\[for new purchases\\\\],” advises Beverly Harzog, consumer finance analyst and author of\\xa0“The Debt Escape Plan: How to Free Yourself from Credit Card Balances, Boost Your Credit Score, and Live Debt-Free.” “Focus on becoming debt-free. This can be challenging, but as you pay down debt, your credit score will start to increase. You’ll feel a rush of adrenaline that will help you stick with it!”\\n\\n## Highlights of the Aven credit card\\n\\n- 7.99%-15.49% variable APR on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. Your initial rate is based on your\\xa0[credit score](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/vantagescore-vs-fico.html)\\n- Up to a $250,000 credit limit, which is MUCH higher than the\\xa0typical card limit of around $3,952\\n- Offers\\xa0[balance transfers](https://www.cardratings.com/balance-transfer/what-is-a-balance-transfer.html)\\xa0and cash outs (directly deposit cash from your card to your bank account, which is similar to a\\xa0[credit card cash advance](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/can-i-get-cash-back-when-i-buy-something-with-a-credit-card.html)) and you have the option of fixed rate monthly payments. Unlike other cards, you can also lock in your payments for five or 10 years. (One-time 2.5 % transfer fee applies for both transfers and cash outs).\\n- You can use funds from a cash out for any purpose and, unlike almost all other credit cards that charge a higher rate for cash advances, the cash out rate is the same as the fixed purchase rate\\n- 2% unlimited cash back on all purchases\\n- Potentially lower fees than a traditional HELOC and a more streamlined, faster application and approval process\\n\\n## Details of the Aven Home card\\n\\n### Rewards\\n\\nAven cardholders earn 2% cash back on every purchases, which is on par with other flat-rate cash-back cards and higher than the base rate of many tiered rate cash-back cards.\\n\\nRewards, however, aren’t terribly flexible. You can redeem your cash back for statement credit, which could save you a bit of money but won’t allow you to strategically maximize the rewards as you can with some points/cash-back cards.\\n\\n### Card fees\\n\\n**Annual fee:** The Aven card offers a $0 annual fee option for all applicants.\\n\\n**Balance transfer fee:** There’s a 2.5% fee for balance transfers, which is higher than the typical fee. If you REALLY need a lengthy period of time (say, more than 18 months) to pay off a chunk of debt, it _might_ be worth it. That said, there are plenty of balance transfer credit cards out there that offer a 0% APR period (15-18 months isn’t hard to find for people with excellent credit) and a fee of 3%. Taken together, that could prove a much better option for most people.\\n\\n**Cash advance fee:** Again, there’s a 2.5% cash advance fee BUT cash advances enjoy the same interest rate as purchases, which is highly unusual. With most cards, you’ll pay a higher interest rate for cash advances than for purchases and balance transfers.\\n\\n**Loan origination fees:** There’s aren’t any! This is where the card shines for people considering a HELOC. In many cases, a HELOC has some origination and processing fees to get your started; but you pay any of that with the Aven card.\\n\\n**APR:** The card advertises that you get “really, really low rates”. While I don’t totally agree with the phrase “really, really low rates,” this card does offer a purchase rate as low as 7.99% (not an\\xa0[introductory or teaser rate](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/0-apr/best-practices-saving-with-an-intro-0-apr-card.html)). In comparison, the national average is around 20%\\xa0[according to NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/credit-card-interest-rates-hit-record-high-rcna56373).\\n\\n“Compared to other credit cards, most of which now have high double digit rates, this is a good deal,” notes Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, author of the New York Times bestseller “Zero Debt: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Freedom” and affectionately known as the\\xa0[Money Coach](https://themoneycoach.net/).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> If you take out a traditional HELOC and use it exclusively for home improvements, the interest on that loan is tax deductible. Talk with a tax adviser about the deductibility of projects completed using your Aven card.\\n\\n## Are there any potential ‘gotchas’ with the Aven card?\\n\\nThe Aven credit card is definitely more complicated than the average card, but really only as it relates to how you qualify and what kind of payment structure you’re anticipating. While this alone isn’t a big cause for concern, there are other potential issues worth discussing.\\n\\n**1)**\\xa0There’s no question that Aven card has attractive rates and a unique value proposition, but the real question is who exactly this offer is best suited for. Obviously, getting a HELOC is not a light decision, particularly since you could lose your house if you get too far behind in payments (since the HELOC is secured by your home)!\\n\\n“Aven has excellent rates because they use your home as collateral, which can be risky,” explains Harzog. “So, think carefully about using the Aven card over, say, an unsecured card with rewards.”\\n\\nKhalfani-Cox points out this card could be a smart choice for applicants who “are financially disciplined and pay their card balances in a timely manner.”\\n\\n**2)**\\xa0Related to point #1, the BIG red flag on this offer is the very real prospect of overspending due to potentially having a large\\xa0[credit line](https://www.cardratings.com/what-factors-determine-the-credit-limit-you-get-on-a-credit-card.html) of up to $250,000 (depending on your credit score and how much equity you have in your house).\\n\\nWhile you might have this same issue if you got a traditional HELOC (one not attached to a card), using this card with a much larger than normal credit line may be extra tempting and cause some consumers to blow their\\xa0[monthly budget](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/should-you-take-a-charging-break.html).\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nIf you think you lack the self restraint required to manage this line of credit — and \\\\[would be\\\\] tempted to utilize your home equity excessively or for unwise purchases — do yourself a favor and avoid the possibility of maxing out this card, and potentially putting both your credit rating and your home at risk.\\n\\n— Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, The Money Coach\\n\\n**3)** While it’s nice to be able to pay off other cards and debts with a fixed monthly payment using the cash-out feature, this feature may not be the best option when considering that [the best 0% balance transfer offers can last up to 21 months](https://www.cardratings.com/best-balance-transfer-credit-cards.html)\\xa0(assuming you can pay off the 0% transfer within the introductory time frame).\\n\\nThe key takeaway here is why pay a low interest rate, when you can potentially pay no interest!\\n\\n“This is an interesting offer and it has some benefits if you have good credit and qualify for a low interest rate,” Harzog explains. “If you have debt on high-interest credit cards, you can do a balance transfer so you can pay your balance off at a lower rate.”\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nBut if you have card debt and still have a very good credit score, it’s better to \\\\[do a normal\\\\] balance transfer and get a 0% rate for a period of time.\\n\\n— Beverly Harzog, Consumer Finance Analyst\\n\\n## Does Aven offer a competitive rewards program?\\n\\nThe short answer is that Aven does offer competitive rebates, but it’s not the “best of breed” when compared to other cash-back offers. If you really like the 2% unlimited cash back benefit on all purchases, you should be aware that there are “normal” rebate cards that offer [2% cash back on purchases (or more) with no annual fees](https://www.cardratings.com/best-credit-cards-for-cash-back-rewards.html#card3387).\\n\\nIf you are trying to pay down debt, that extra .5% (or more) on some purchases could help you out.\\n\\n“Paying down debt could make my earnings go further rather than just using my cash back to buy stuff off Amazon like I’ve done in the past,” notes Scott Bonge, the founder of\\xa0[MyPerfectGoatee.com](https://www.myperfectgoatee.com/), and a long-term rewards credit card user.\\n\\n“It’s really a matter of personal preference, money-management style and existing credit resources,” Khalfani-Cox adds. “Someone who doesn’t need a HELOC, perhaps because they already have one or don’t want to draw down on that line, may be better off with a traditional 2% cash back card.\\n\\n“But for someone who prefers lower rates (ongoing, not intro.) and/or having the flexibility that a HELOC-type card provides, the Aven card may be more beneficial.”\\n\\nThe bottom line is that while Aven has a decent rewards program, you shouldn’t apply for this offer solely based on it’s rewards program. The rebates should be viewed simply as an added bonus (pun intended).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> As is the case with other reward cards, you can not earn rebates on balance transfers and cash outs. The redemption options for Aven are limited as cash-back rebates are only redeemable as a statement credit (you can’t get gift cards, a check in the mail, etc).\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nThe Aven Home card has introduced a creative way for homeowners to conveniently take advantage of their equity. I love their hybrid approach and I do believe this offer can definitely be a blessing to a certain demographic, particularly when considering the economic environment we find ourselves in.\\n\\nI also love the balance transfer and cash out feature, but would caution current and potential cardholders to remember a few “old school” debt reduction principles when using this new card to consolidate and/or pay down debt.\\n\\n“In general, I recommend people prioritize paying off their debts organically — meaning they use cash to pay it off, not another form of borrowing,” Khalfani-Cox elaborates. “There’s a difference between a ‘zero debt'”‘ strategy — which seeks to eliminate debt progressively — and a ‘shift debt’ strategy, which really just pushes the debt around from one form of credit or borrowing to another.\\n\\n_“_ Because I once had a ton of credit card debt before paying it off, I do understand the ‘shift debt’ strategy,” Khalfani-Cox conitinues. “It’s the same strategy, in effect, that people have used (myself included) when they do balance transfers. You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a ‘shift debt’ strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it’s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt. Ultimately, you do have to pay the piper and pay off what you owe.”\\n\\nUltimately, as Khalfani-Cox reminded me in a recent interview, it pays to have a set of rules for when you will use credit. Ask yourself: under what circumstances and for what types of purchases will I use this card or this form of credit — and then stick to that.

The 3% cash back is obviously interesting, I suspect you might also be able to get large credit limits as it’s tied to your home equity. This could help boost your FICO score.

These features include:\\n\\n- **Instant prequalification**: Aven begins every application with an initial screening. You’ll know within seconds if you’re preapproved, and go from application all the way to closing in 15 minutes.\\n- **Automatic income verification**: Aven uses a variety of sources to automatically verify your income, which makes the process quick and easy. Some customers may be asked to connect your bank account or manually upload proof of income.\\n- **No property restrictions**: Primary residence? No problem. Investment property? Bring it on. New build? That’s fine, too. Aven considers every property, even those held in a trust.\\n- **Minimal insurance requirements**: Aven doesn’t require proof of insurance unless your home is in a flood zone or your credit line is more than $100,000.\\n- **Digital appraisals and notarization:** You can complete the entire HELOC process from a phone or computer. Aven uses automated valuation models (AVMs), which rely on recent sale information, current-year tax assessments, and other data to [determine your home value](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-is-home-value-determined-for-heloc/), and its online notaries help you close on your HELOC 100% online. No signing of paper docs is needed.\\n- **Fast funding**: You can start using your HELOC three business days after signing.\\n\\nIn addition, **all AvenCash HELOCs come with fixed rates**. While some lenders let you convert variable rates to fixed rates, only a few offer fixed rates for your entire term. Fixed rates provide stability and predictability in your monthly payment—it won’t fluctuate unless you withdraw additional funds or pay down your outstanding balance.\\n\\n![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/plugins/lendeducom-gutenberg-blocks/src/assets/img/readmore.svg)\\n\\nRead More\\n\\n[What is a home equity line of credit?](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit/)\\n\\n## How do you draw from and repay an Aven HELOC?\\n\\nAven lets you [pull from your HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-draw-period-work-on-heloc/) as often as you need over five years. However, it’s important to note that Aven requires you to draw the full HELOC amount at origination.\\n\\nSo, while you can redraw from your line anytime during the five-year draw period, you’ll need to repay some of the balance to free up funds before making additional withdrawals.\\n\\nOnce you enter [HELOC repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-heloc-repayment-work/), Aven allows you to customize your repayment period anywhere from five to 30 years to pay off your credit line.\\n\\n## Do Aven HELOCs come with any unique borrower benefits?\\n\\nIn addition to the features and rates that make Aven’s HELOC a solid competitor in the home equity marketplace, the company offers some unique benefits that we find valuable for HELOC borrowers. These include:\\n\\n- **Lowest rate guarantee:** If you qualify with other HELOC lenders and can get a lower rate elsewhere, let Aven know, and it will beat the offer or send you $100.\\n- **Refinancing available:** Homeowners with a second lien (like an existing HELOC or [home equity loan](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-loan/)) can refinance it into an Aven HELOC. There are no origination fees or transfer fees to refinance.\\n- **Automatic credit line increases:** If you make on-time payments and/or your home equity increases, Aven will automatically invite you for a credit line increase.\\n- **Debt protection through Securian:** Aven offers a unique program in which borrowers can pay a monthly fee ranging from $0.92 to $1.75 per $1,000 of HELOC balance—up to $50,000. If you become involuntarily unemployed (meaning you are laid off or let go from your job), Securian will cover six months of minimum payments up to $1,000 per month.\\n\\n## Who’s eligible for an Aven HELOC?\\n\\nQualifying for an Aven HELOC hinges primarily on your [credit score](https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-score-needed-home-equity-loans/), built-up equity, and location.\\n\\nAs with most lenders, Aven needs to see that you can handle additional debt and that your home’s value will hold steady until that debt is repaid.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that Aven accepts joint applications, which could be helpful if you apply with a spouse, for example, with a higher credit score.\\n\\nAven doesn’t lend in every state, however. Here are Aven’s eligibility criteria and residency requirements in greater detail:\\n\\n| **Requirements** | **Details** |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Eligible properties | Primary residences and investment properties |\\n| State of residence | Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming |\\n| Maximum loan-to-value (LTV) | 89% |\\n| Maximum debt-to-income | Not disclosed |\\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\\n| Minimum income | Not disclosed |\\n\\n## What are the costs and fees of an Aven HELOC?\\n\\nYou won’t pay many fees with Aven, but its HELOC isn’t entirely fee-free. **While Aven doesn’t charge application or appraisal fees, it does levy a 4.90% first-draw fee, which is essentially an origination fee**. Aven also assesses a $29 late fee on its home equity card, though it’s unclear if this applies to AvenCash.\\n\\nHowever, fees are only one piece of the HELOC affordability puzzle. These fees work in tandem with your interest rate to create your annual percentage rate (APR). Your APR reflects the true premium you pay for your credit line, so locking in the lowest possible APR is imperative.\\n\\nTo better illustrate how APR can influence your borrowing cost, let’s say that you withdraw $50,000 from your HELOC at an 11% APR. Here’s how much your HELOC would cost over time:\\n\\n![Infographic showing how APR can influence borrowing cost.](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcb25g1LtEo-kbiI6k7EzoIkL0_SJOwQTyjQ-kVI25QaZfTk9d4u22Gf1JuvxwlmaJolZXGNFSJIJa7wEJ9g0pCa3zIeq2R2APXFvLhs7UQ9PAsE4_Pe8d6dvm-FtpKYgpVR9KetxA6NAe2ra9_FZ0-Nlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\\n\\nWhat started as a $50,000 balance ballooned into a six-figure price tag because of your 11% APR. But what if you held out for a better rate and qualified for a 9% APR instead? How might that change your payments and overall borrowing cost?\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe5uFidA5GimocFg2duH_EjR8H1VydxvXSTen9tXS9JhKawHYYJPw59-qBmV5XTkoGCtBgesakhAPOz47jbNqEt2lyAiRl5f3bSKlyWK3NQ0_skxu9bMFNjVioskgX4FVXifVgLH8msS_iBSwgg4T9ohlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\\n\\nIf we look just at your monthly payments, particularly your payments once your draw period ends, it’s easy to miss how influential your APR really is.\\n\\nHowever, we can see your APR’s cumulative impact when we zoom out. Not only are your monthly payments more affordable at the lower rate, but you’ve also saved $11,531 over the life of your HELOC.\\n\\n## How does your home’s value affect your terms?\\n\\nIn addition to your credit score, Aven’s automated underwriting process also\\xa0[factors in your home equity](https://www.aven.com/support/article/360061758811#:~:text=an%20applicant%27s%20income%2C-,equity,-%2C%20credit%2C%20and%20debt)\\xa0and, by extension, your home’s value. Generally speaking, **lower home values and lower equity translate to lower credit limits, higher rates, or both**.\\n\\nThis is where LTV comes into play. This ratio compares what you owe on your home to what it’s worth. Aven accepts up to an 89% LTV, so your combined home-secured debt can’t exceed 89% of your home’s value.\\n\\nThat home-secured debt includes any existing financing, like your mortgage, as well as your new HELOC. Say, for instance, that you owe $150,000 on a $300,000 home. Here’s how Aven might calculate [how much you can borrow with a HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-much-can-i-borrow-on-heloc/) in light of its LTV threshold:\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf8laOyBZE4hyFaQjraHA0UXi07mLGHaRsM_J8Iwi5FjB-bJ9qiyKU1SMadNcicL6s8UF5oV9gQfMWYhwhdCyRV0vWypKluLfrbPhgulFnmIIsItqw4H5jz-RXbxysOJCxuzcX7PHtKQPMQZdfm3estd1g?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\\n\\nBut what if Aven determined your home value to be slightly higher? Take a look below to see how much more you could borrow if your home appraised at $325,000 instead:\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkkXz_Rr33A4nn6_basjCc-E7EIuCDb_-K-KH48e3wkeyF18o-2lU3TICaBZcXS-hZ6rWZG8EMoQS0Vo68dCePXyy_jcxJmNYIr8zZrRiBCK_2GP_5F0v-5_sHNOqX09krx-rxDln9ev3p1Sfly6_7w3YC?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\\n\\nIn our first example, $117,000 was the largest HELOC you could get without surpassing the 89% cap. With the increased property value in our second example, your potential HELOC limit went up by $22,250.\\n\\nBefore you rush to remodel your kitchen, we should mention that virtual appraisals don’t always capture improvements like these. That’s because these appraisals rely on tax data and recent selling prices of nearby homes, not necessarily a physical examination of your property.\\n\\nRather than investing in renovations you weren’t otherwise planning, you may see better results—both to your HELOC limit and your long-term financial position—by reducing your mortgage balance instead.\\n\\n## Pros & cons of Aven HELOCs\\n\\nPros\\n\\n- High maximum LTV\\n\\nAven’s 89% LTV threshold makes its HELOC more accessible to more homeowners. It also means you could open a larger HELOC than you’d qualify for elsewhere.\\n\\n- Fixed rates\\n\\nWith Aven, your HELOC rate will never change, so you’ll know what to expect month after month.\\n\\n- Few fees\\n\\nUnlike some of its competitors, Aven doesn’t charge application, appraisal, or notary fees. You won’t pay an annual fee, either.\\n\\n- Customizable repayment options\\n\\nAven offers four different repayment periods, and you can choose the term that best suits your finances.\\n\\n- Completely virtual application and appraisal\\n\\nYou’ll forego the time and hassle of scheduling a traditional appraisal with Aven. You could apply and get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\\n\\n- Unique borrower benefits\\n\\nFrom its lowest rate guarantee to its debt protection program, Aven offers borrowers unique benefits you can’t find with other lenders.\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n- Virtual appraisals aren’t always accurate\\n\\nWhile convenient, automated appraisals aren’t as thorough as in-person valuations. Because it can’t catch everything, Aven’s system might undervalue your home.\\n\\n- Not available everywhere\\n\\nAven only lends in 32 states, rendering many homeowners ineligible for its HELOC.\\n\\n- Limited draw period\\n\\nAven’s draw period is considerably shorter than what you might get with another lender, which is only five years.\\n\\n- Full amount is drawn at origination\\n\\nAven requires borrowers to draw their entire HELOC amount initially, meaning you must repay some of the balance within that five-year draw period to redraw funds as needed.\\n\\n- No introductory rates or rate discounts\\n\\nSome HELOC companies offer perks like a reduced rate for your first 12 months or when you sign up for autopay. Aven, however, isn’t one of them.\\n\\n\\n## Is Aven a reputable lender?\\n\\n**Aven’s thousands of positive Trustpilot reviews and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) certainly lend the company credibility**.\\n\\nWhile most of Aven’s existing reviews center on its HELOC card, we can use those reviews to infer the service quality you’ll experience with its traditional HELOC. Here’s a closer look at how past customers rate the lender:\\n\\n| | | |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Source | Customer rating | Number of reviews |\\n| Trustpilot | 4.9 stars | 3,811 |\\n| Better Business Bureau | 1 star | 7 |\\n\\nCollected on August 30, 2024.\\n\\nDespite the one-star customer rating on the site, we consider Aven’s A+ rating from the BBB a significant endorsement of its reliability. With a limited sample size of just seven reviews, we weigh those reviews less heavily than the 3,793 reviews on Trustpilot, where Aven boasts an impressive 4.9-star rating.\\n\\nThe combination of an A+ BBB rating and the overwhelmingly positive Trustpilot feedback is what led us to designate Aven’s HELOC as the best for customer reviews.\\n\\nEfficiency and clear communication are common threads throughout Aven’s Trustpilot reviews. Many borrowers applaud the company’s quick application process and speak highly of its customer support team.\\n\\nOf course, no lender is perfect. Aven’s lowest ratings come from customers frustrated by a lack of clear communication. One reviewer reported getting mixed messages regarding their approval, while another shared that their HELOC card was frozen unexpectedly.\\n\\n## Does Aven have a customer service team?\\n\\nWhether you’re seeking general information or have a specific question, Aven’s team is ready to help. The San Francisco-based company offers multiple ways to get in touch:\\n\\n- **Email**: Connect with the Aven team by emailing [\\\\[email\\xa0protected\\\\]](https://lendedu.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebdbbbebea1bcba8eafb8aba0e0ada1a3).\\n- **Contact form**: Send a message to Aven’s representatives directly from the website.\\n- **Phone**: Call Aven at [415-582-6613](tel:415-582-6613) to leave a voice message. Alternatively, you can [schedule a callback](https://aven.com/call) online.\\n\\nAven doesn’t list its hours of operation, and it encourages homeowners to use email for faster communication. If you prefer to speak with a live human, consider scheduling a callback instead.\\n\\n## How to apply for an Aven HELOC\\n\\nAven’s tech-powered HELOC application process is just as innovative as its product offerings. Here’s how it works:\\n\\n1. **Enter your phone number to start the application**. Alternatively, you can enter your Aven invite code if you have one.\\n2. **Tell Aven how much you need to borrow**. You’ll also tell Aven how you plan to use your credit line.\\n3. **Provide your contact details and identifying information**. This includes your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you’re applying with another person, you’ll also enter their information.\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQq2Yj2vKOqDLmkbC6JpgpyyfL_WskxdA-bpUX6BFu3Gypl81WFEdW6KMFusEurKGSRp6wRsTiiWKDULDXHBhHcbK97e9ZPtIfTYJr5_beqx_DxSe0uiNwP1RvyE2Kd1FjozDb8d3fqpg88yYCDUyv4vFO?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\\n\\n1. **View your prequalified offers**. At this stage, you haven’t consented to a hard credit pull. You’re simply getting Aven’s preliminary approval and choosing the potential HELOC terms that work best for you.\\n2. **Verify your income**. Aven automatically verifies the majority of its customers’ income when you apply. Some customers may be asked to either link your bank account with Plaid or send in documents like W-2s or 1099s for manual review.\\n\\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeopdNOh-WyLQpZnRlNj2Z6Dzty5zTxtkvyPkQXTk-DbS8e8iGxhurP4nsMgKi5EuBbF9x97CNy07K5gJp23a0JY619tsxwxHwlTdXr1h4pJjzVD29gKtZwkeq-ocl75OWwCLpfKd2ZTyK7iRweZ1lyBkw?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\\n\\n1. **Submit your application**.Now, you’ll give Aven permission to run your credit and present you with a final HELOC offer.\\n2. **Schedule your notary session**. If approved, Aven will connect you with an online notary to review and sign your documents.\\n\\nAfter reading your HELOC agreement, prepare to hang tight through the mandatory [three-day waiting period](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/home-equity-loans-and-home-equity-lines-credit#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Three%2DDay,cancel%20the%20deal%20without%20penalty.). As soon as this window passes, Aven will fund your HELOC, and you’ll have access to your new credit line.\\n\\n## Aven HELOC alternatives\\n\\nFor many homeowners, Aven may be the clear winner, and for good reason. Still, it’s wise to consider your options before committing to a lender. Here are three of the [best HELOC lenders](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-line-of-credit/) available:\\n\\n| **Company** | **Best for…** | **Rating**(0-5) |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| ![Figure logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/figure_refi.png) 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best overall | 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\\n| ![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FourLeaf_logo_EHL-NMLS_FCU-1.png) 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for large HELOCs | 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\\n| ![lendingtree logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lendingtree-logo.png) 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for comparison shopping | 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\\n\\nWhile these companies share commonalities with Aven, each one offers distinct advantages that Aven doesn’t:\\n\\n- [**Figure**](https://lendedu.com/blog/figure-home-equity-loan-review/) is available in more states. It also allows LTVs up to 95%.\\n- [**FourLeaf**](https://lendedu.com/blog/bethpage-home-equity-review/) boasts a 10-year draw period and HELOCs up to $1 million.\\n- [**LendingTree**](https://lendedu.com/blog/lendingtree-home-equity-loans-review/) shows you multiple prequalified offers in one place.\\n\\nThose prequalified offers are key to choosing the right lender. They tell you instantly which companies can give you the HELOC you’re looking for and which ones can’t.\\n\\nSince prequalifying doesn’t hurt your credit, we recommend checking your rates with at least four lenders. Compare each offer, paying close attention to APRs, credit limits, and term lengths.\\n\\nIt may be tempting to accept the first HELOC offer you get. But by slowing down and carefully evaluating your options, you’ll boost your odds of locking in not just any HELOC but a HELOC that’s virtually tailor-made for you.\\n\\n## How we rated Aven\\n\\nWe designed LendEDU’s editorial rating system to help readers find companies that offer the best HELOCs. Our system awards higher ratings to companies with affordable solutions, positive customer reviews, and online transparency of benefits and terms.\\n\\nWe compared Aven to several home equity lenders, using hundreds of data points from company websites, public disclosures, customer reviews, and direct communication with company representatives. We weighted, scored, and combined each factor to produce a final editorial rating. This rating is expressed on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest possible score.

I attempted to create an account with the company about a week ago. Since it had been nearly a week and I hadn\\'t heard anything from the company, I decided to call to see what was going on with my account and if a card had been issued. While I was patient with the representative I spoke with, they were very rude and impatient with me. They cut me off, and when they finally allowed me to finish speaking, they got an attitude about it and acted very snarky and condescending. They questioned everything I was saying and informed me that the company is working on their systems and that they are migrating to a new platform, and that customers are unable to create a new account at this time. When I said this is information that should be on the company\\'s website so that customers don\\'t waste their time attempting to create an account, the representative got snarky again and simply stated that they gave me that information and proceeded to get very argumentative. I have worked in call centers myself, and I understand that it can be trying; however, particularly when someone is being patient and not disrespectful toward you, there is no reason to be so disrespectful toward them. The level of snarky behavior was off the charts. Even though I wish that I hadn\\'t wasted my time attempting to create an account with this company and dealing with their sorry customer service, I\\'m relieved that I had this experience because I dodged a bullet. This is not a company that values its customers or treats people with any sort of common decency. My advice: steer CLEAR of this company, trust me, you can do better!\\n\\nShow More\\n\\nDate of experience: April 7, 2025\\n\\nComments\\n\\n![](https://www.sitejabber.com/imgs/review-confirmation/heart.svg) Thank You\\n\\n![](https://www.sitejabber.com/imgs/reviews/lightball.webp) Helpful (0)\\n\\n[![](https://www.sitejabber.com/img/stock_photos/265/thumbnail_large.1476463632.jpg)](https://www.sitejabber.com/users/jayeffe2000)\\n\\n[James F.](https://www.sitejabber.com/users/jayeffe2000)\\n\\nOhio 1 review 3 helpful votes\\n\\nFollow James F.\\n\\nUnfollow James F.\\n\\nSend Message\\n\\nShare Review\\n\\nReport Review\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[This bank is a joke..](https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/avidprepaid.com#10)\\n\\nOctober 26, 2023\\n\\nI enrolled for early access, but end up not getting paid.\\n\\nCustomer service is a joke too.

They are really good from blocking thieves from other countries from stealing your money. I saw a chair on Facebook they usually cost 400 dollars. And the ad said they was going out of business and selling for $20.00 so I order it and Avid card blocked it asap. When I called to see why they told me it\\'s a scammer Operating out of Another country. They closed my account they told me and was sending me a new card by fed ex in two days.

Don\\'t let their fear tactics \"if you cancel your subscription, your credit will drop\" keep you from canceling. I did, and my score actually went up by 16 points. The worst part of utilizing this card is that you can only use it for subscriptions, and even if everything is linked via auto-pay, the card constantly falls off your credit report on a monthly basis. It\\'s like you\\'re opening a new credit card every single month, which is not good for credit age and impacts your score much worse than having a 30-day late payment.

For one, you don\\'t get what they promise, and you still only get to use about 25 dollars. They tell you this after you sign up.

I\\'ve been trying to get in touch with them, but they won\\'t refund my money or respond to my emails. It\\'s such a scam! Please don\\'t do it.

The approval amount is \"up to $2500,\" not the full $2500 they advertise on the website. It\\'s supposed to help boost your credit and lower your debt ratio, and you can only use $25 of the limit they approve you for, which is $1275. You can only use it to pay for certain monthly subscriptions; however, you can\\'t even use it to pay for those subscriptions. I tried Amazon Prime and Amazon Audible; neither works. The customer service clearly is not American because they don\\'t understand English and respond with a response that has nothing to do with what you asked them. There\\'s no phone support, and they do not report to your credit unless you use the card, but you can\\'t even use it, which is quite ironic. I will be reporting them to the FTC and reporting it as fraud to get it off my credit report, but you have been warned: stay away. Oh, and when they report to the credit bureaus, such as TransUnion, it reports as an installment, not revolving, and they say they are not in control of that. They can\\'t or won\\'t fix it even though I signed up for a credit card.\\n\\nshow more\\n\\nshow less\\n\\nProduct: Ava Credit Cards\\n\\nComment\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\nAva\\n\\nNatasha Simmons\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2024 • @b\\\\_b\\\\_cruz\\n\\nReport Abuse\\n\\n1 Star Rating\\n\\nVerified Customer\\n\\nI\\'ve never had an AVA account.

This company makes it very difficult to make the payments and does not care about their customers at all. I had my bank account locked due to fraud and I work Monday-Friday from 8 am to 10 pm. I explained to them I was unable to pay with my bank account as all my funds go to my Cash App. I also like to buy stocks and bitcoins, and my bank account is restricted until I can go there in person. After my debit card was closed by my bank, I tried using my Cash App card, but the app said they do not accept prepaid cards. I attempted to use my credit card, but they only accept ACH and debit cards, even though my Cash App has a whole account number and a routing number. I even get my taxes sent to my Cash App, but my card isn\\'t good enough to be used with an app that I was under the impression would help me build my credit. So, after falling 60 days behind on a loan of $21 a month due to the hassle of trying to pay them with their super limited payment options, I started paying someone to allow me to use their debit card and caught my account up, but my credit score dropped 80 points. I talked to them, and they basically said there\\'s nothing they can do, even under the circumstances, every other credit business either pause your account or atleast acknowledge a goodwill letter especially under these types of circumstances so now I\\'m basically paying them to ruin my credit as I can\\'t even pay off my account early to terminate further business with them. If I could I would give this company a negative 5 stars. Be advised this company is not here to help you financially or with building credit they only care about taking advantage of their customers and making a profit.\\n\\nshow more\\n\\nshow less\\n\\nProduct: Ava Savings & CDs\\n\\nComment\\n\\n2\\n\\n0\\n\\nAva\\n\\nCrystal\\n\\nNovember 19, 2023 • @crystalmonroer89\\n\\nReport Abuse\\n\\n5 Star Rating\\n\\nVerified Customer\\n\\nThis card is good but I\\'m not using it anymore.

Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\\n\\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\\n\\nWhat is my monthly payment?\\n\\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card.

Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\\n\\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\\n\\nAre there any fees?\\n\\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees.

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\\n\\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\\n\\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\\n\\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\\n\\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\\n\\nWhat is my monthly payment?\\n\\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\\n\\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\\n\\nCan I get cash too?\\n\\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\\n\\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\\n\\nDoes this affect my credit score?\\n\\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\\n\\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\\n\\nAre there any fees?\\n\\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don’t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\\n\\n##### More Questions...\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n# Become an Expert\\n\\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\\n\\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\\\\n\\\\\\nYes!

Aven is on a mission to provide consumers with the lowest cost and most convenient access to capital. Their first product - the Aven Home Card - allows homeowners to access their home equity in minutes, starting at $0 to get, with all the benefits of a traditional credit card. Since launching in California in 2022, the company has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines for the Home Card, earning a 4.9 star rating on Trustpilot. The company has saved customers over $100 million in interest payments to date.\\n\\n\"We believe there\\'s no reason for anyone who owns an asset and has good credit history to use unsecured credit. Full stop. Unsecured credit is expensive and unhealthy,” said Sadi Khan, co-founder and CEO of Aven. “With our asset-backed credit cards, we give consumers credit for what they own - saving them thousands of dollars without sacrificing convenience.”\\n\\nHomeowners have been drawn to Aven’s ease, efficiency and lower cost of accessing capital:\\n\\n- Save 50% or more on monthly interest rates - with rates as low as 7.99% APR – the lowest APR of any credit card in the US1\\n- No annual fee, no notarization/closing fee option available in every state that Aven operates in\\n- 2% unlimited cashback and 7% cashback on hotels booked in the Aven travel portal\\n- Credit lines up to $250,000\\n- Approval in less than 5 minutes and closing in as fast as 15 minutes\\n- Pay only for what you use and debt protection offered to protect against adverse events2\\n\\nLast year, Aven grew revenue ~3x and broadened its offering to include a free, mobile-first financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor, which has quickly amassed over 160,000 members. The growth investment will be used to offer Aven’s Home Card in all 50 states, scale Advisor, and expand into new categories including auto-backed cards, mortgage refinance, and more.\\n\\n“By using technology to drive efficiency, Aven has built a product that responsibly helps drive down the cost of capital by over 50% for most US homeowners who are using alternative credit cards,” said Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures.\\n\\nThe company is also announcing an advisory board - focused on helping the company scale while protecting the interests of its cardholders and offering insights on industry conditions and strategic opportunities. The Aven Advisory Board will be made up of four executives: Michael DeVito, former CEO of Freddie Mac; Tim Mayopoulos, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jim Messina, former Deputy Chief of Staff to the White House under the Obama administration; and Kevin Warsh, former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\\n\\n“I was blown away by the Aven team when I first met them several years ago. But I was initially skeptical that their core product would scale in the staid, calcified industry structure that has prevailed in the mortgage market for decades. The Aven team is proving the skeptics wrong in a big way. I am thrilled to be their partner,” said Kevin Warsh, Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.\\n\\nAven is currently available in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming with a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\\n\\nFor more information visit [www.aven.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aven.com%2F&esheet=54095442&newsitemid=20240717039124&lan=en-US&anchor=www.aven.com&index=1&md5=61b1081fd6160cadbc72f8b91fdb61e7).\\n\\n**About Aven**\\n\\nAven is the best credit card for smart homeowners.

Aven was founded in 2019 by Sadi Khan, Collin Wikman, and Murtada Shah, former product, design, and engineering executives at Facebook and Square. Aven is on a mission to provide consumers with the lowest cost and most convenient access to capital. Their first product - the Aven Home Card - allows homeowners to access their home equity in minutes, starting at $0 to get, with all the benefits of a traditional credit card. Since launching in California in 2022, the company has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines for the Home Card, earning a 4.9 star rating on Trustpilot. The company has saved customers over $100 million in interest payments to date. \"We believe there\\'s no reason for anyone who owns an asset and has good credit history to use unsecured credit. Full stop. Unsecured credit is expensive and unhealthy,” said Sadi Khan, co-founder and CEO of Aven. “With our asset-backed credit cards, we give consumers credit for what they own - saving them thousands of dollars without sacrificing convenience.” Homeowners have been drawn to Aven’s ease, efficiency and lower cost of accessing capital: Save 50% or more on monthly interest rates - with rates as low as 7.99% APR – the lowest APR of any credit card in the US 1 No annual fee, no notarization/closing fee option available in every state that Aven operates in 2% unlimited cashback and 7% cashback on hotels booked in the Aven travel portal Credit lines up to $250,000 Approval in less than 5 minutes and closing in as fast as 15 minutes Pay only for what you use and debt protection offered to protect against adverse events 2 Last year, Aven grew revenue ~3x and broadened its offering to include a free, mobile-first financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor, which has quickly amassed over 160,000 members. The growth investment will be used to offer Aven’s Home Card in all 50 states, scale Advisor, and expand into new categories including auto-backed cards, mortgage refinance, and more. “By using technology to drive efficiency, Aven has built a product that responsibly helps drive down the cost of capital by over 50% for most US homeowners who are using alternative credit cards,” said Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures. The company is also announcing an advisory board - focused on helping the company scale while protecting the interests of its cardholders and offering insights on industry conditions and strategic opportunities. The Aven Advisory Board will be made up of four executives: Michael DeVito, former CEO of Freddie Mac; Tim Mayopoulos, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jim Messina, former Deputy Chief of Staff to the White House under the Obama administration; and Kevin Warsh, former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. “I was blown away by the Aven team when I first met them several years ago. But I was initially skeptical that their core product would scale in the staid, calcified industry structure that has prevailed in the mortgage market for decades. The Aven team is proving the skeptics wrong in a big way. I am thrilled to be their partner,” said Kevin Warsh, Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Aven is currently available in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming with a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.

What they haven’t historically been so good at is addressing personal finance needs as they relate to your rent or mortgage.\\n\\nRecently, though, homeowners have a specific credit card to get excited about. The Aven Home card is designed to be a cross between a rewards card and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Given the unique hybrid nature of this offer, I think it has the potential to change the way we think about credit cards, particularly among home owners.\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> Don’t feel left out, Renters! There’s a card aimed at helping you out in an all-new way as well: The [CardName](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/aven-home-card-is-it-worth-it.html) discontinued allows you to earn rewards on your rent payments without incurring any transaction or processing fees.\\n\\n## How does the Aven Home card work?\\n\\nWhen it comes to day-to-day use, the Aven card works like a regular Visa card, so you can enjoy the convenience of a credit card with the lower interest rates associated with a HELOC. It’s the underwriting and fee structure of the Aven credit card that sets it apart– basically, the card utilizes your home’s equity as a form of collateral to secure your credit line and lower rates.\\n\\nWhen you apply for the card, the issuer will verify your income and credit score/history as well as the equity in your home. Assuming you’re approved, you’ll receive the card in the mail soon after.\\n\\n> Home equity loan vs. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)\\n>\\n> How does a HELOC differ from a home equity loan? In short:\\n>\\n> - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower’s home – your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable.\\n> - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you’ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events – like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option.\\n\\nYour monthly minimum payments will be 1% of your principal balance, plus interest and any fees. It’s a setup that’s fairly typical for a credit card.\\n\\nWhere Aven differs is that you have the option to set up fixed monthly payments for balance transfers and cash outs. In that case, you won’t pay interest on those transactions, but you will pay a set monthly fee. A number of mainstream banks, including Chase and Citibank, offer similar payment setups for certain purchases on their qualifying cards.\\n\\n➤\\xa0LEARN MORE: [Credit card built-in fixed APR personal loans vs. traditional personal loans](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/debt/credit-card-built-in-fixed-apr-personal-loans-vs-traditional-personal-loans.html)\\n\\nIf you’re considering the Aven credit card as a balance transfer option, it’s best to not think about it as a purchase card option until that balance is paid off.\\n\\n“If you’re in credit card debt, stop using your cards \\\\[for new purchases\\\\],” advises Beverly Harzog, consumer finance analyst and author of\\xa0“The Debt Escape Plan: How to Free Yourself from Credit Card Balances, Boost Your Credit Score, and Live Debt-Free.” “Focus on becoming debt-free. This can be challenging, but as you pay down debt, your credit score will start to increase. You’ll feel a rush of adrenaline that will help you stick with it!”\\n\\n## Highlights of the Aven credit card\\n\\n- 7.99%-15.49% variable APR on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. Your initial rate is based on your\\xa0[credit score](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/vantagescore-vs-fico.html)\\n- Up to a $250,000 credit limit, which is MUCH higher than the\\xa0typical card limit of around $3,952\\n- Offers\\xa0[balance transfers](https://www.cardratings.com/balance-transfer/what-is-a-balance-transfer.html)\\xa0and cash outs (directly deposit cash from your card to your bank account, which is similar to a\\xa0[credit card cash advance](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/can-i-get-cash-back-when-i-buy-something-with-a-credit-card.html)) and you have the option of fixed rate monthly payments. Unlike other cards, you can also lock in your payments for five or 10 years. (One-time 2.5 % transfer fee applies for both transfers and cash outs).\\n- You can use funds from a cash out for any purpose and, unlike almost all other credit cards that charge a higher rate for cash advances, the cash out rate is the same as the fixed purchase rate\\n- 2% unlimited cash back on all purchases\\n- Potentially lower fees than a traditional HELOC and a more streamlined, faster application and approval process\\n\\n## Details of the Aven Home card\\n\\n### Rewards\\n\\nAven cardholders earn 2% cash back on every purchases, which is on par with other flat-rate cash-back cards and higher than the base rate of many tiered rate cash-back cards.\\n\\nRewards, however, aren’t terribly flexible. You can redeem your cash back for statement credit, which could save you a bit of money but won’t allow you to strategically maximize the rewards as you can with some points/cash-back cards.\\n\\n### Card fees\\n\\n**Annual fee:** The Aven card offers a $0 annual fee option for all applicants.\\n\\n**Balance transfer fee:** There’s a 2.5% fee for balance transfers, which is higher than the typical fee. If you REALLY need a lengthy period of time (say, more than 18 months) to pay off a chunk of debt, it _might_ be worth it. That said, there are plenty of balance transfer credit cards out there that offer a 0% APR period (15-18 months isn’t hard to find for people with excellent credit) and a fee of 3%. Taken together, that could prove a much better option for most people.\\n\\n**Cash advance fee:** Again, there’s a 2.5% cash advance fee BUT cash advances enjoy the same interest rate as purchases, which is highly unusual. With most cards, you’ll pay a higher interest rate for cash advances than for purchases and balance transfers.\\n\\n**Loan origination fees:** There’s aren’t any! This is where the card shines for people considering a HELOC. In many cases, a HELOC has some origination and processing fees to get your started; but you pay any of that with the Aven card.\\n\\n**APR:** The card advertises that you get “really, really low rates”. While I don’t totally agree with the phrase “really, really low rates,” this card does offer a purchase rate as low as 7.99% (not an\\xa0[introductory or teaser rate](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/0-apr/best-practices-saving-with-an-intro-0-apr-card.html)). In comparison, the national average is around 20%\\xa0[according to NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/credit-card-interest-rates-hit-record-high-rcna56373).\\n\\n“Compared to other credit cards, most of which now have high double digit rates, this is a good deal,” notes Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, author of the New York Times bestseller “Zero Debt: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Freedom” and affectionately known as the\\xa0[Money Coach](https://themoneycoach.net/).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> If you take out a traditional HELOC and use it exclusively for home improvements, the interest on that loan is tax deductible. Talk with a tax adviser about the deductibility of projects completed using your Aven card.\\n\\n## Are there any potential ‘gotchas’ with the Aven card?\\n\\nThe Aven credit card is definitely more complicated than the average card, but really only as it relates to how you qualify and what kind of payment structure you’re anticipating. While this alone isn’t a big cause for concern, there are other potential issues worth discussing.\\n\\n**1)**\\xa0There’s no question that Aven card has attractive rates and a unique value proposition, but the real question is who exactly this offer is best suited for. Obviously, getting a HELOC is not a light decision, particularly since you could lose your house if you get too far behind in payments (since the HELOC is secured by your home)!\\n\\n“Aven has excellent rates because they use your home as collateral, which can be risky,” explains Harzog. “So, think carefully about using the Aven card over, say, an unsecured card with rewards.”\\n\\nKhalfani-Cox points out this card could be a smart choice for applicants who “are financially disciplined and pay their card balances in a timely manner.”\\n\\n**2)**\\xa0Related to point #1, the BIG red flag on this offer is the very real prospect of overspending due to potentially having a large\\xa0[credit line](https://www.cardratings.com/what-factors-determine-the-credit-limit-you-get-on-a-credit-card.html) of up to $250,000 (depending on your credit score and how much equity you have in your house).\\n\\nWhile you might have this same issue if you got a traditional HELOC (one not attached to a card), using this card with a much larger than normal credit line may be extra tempting and cause some consumers to blow their\\xa0[monthly budget](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/should-you-take-a-charging-break.html).\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nIf you think you lack the self restraint required to manage this line of credit — and \\\\[would be\\\\] tempted to utilize your home equity excessively or for unwise purchases — do yourself a favor and avoid the possibility of maxing out this card, and potentially putting both your credit rating and your home at risk.\\n\\n— Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, The Money Coach\\n\\n**3)** While it’s nice to be able to pay off other cards and debts with a fixed monthly payment using the cash-out feature, this feature may not be the best option when considering that [the best 0% balance transfer offers can last up to 21 months](https://www.cardratings.com/best-balance-transfer-credit-cards.html)\\xa0(assuming you can pay off the 0% transfer within the introductory time frame).\\n\\nThe key takeaway here is why pay a low interest rate, when you can potentially pay no interest!\\n\\n“This is an interesting offer and it has some benefits if you have good credit and qualify for a low interest rate,” Harzog explains. “If you have debt on high-interest credit cards, you can do a balance transfer so you can pay your balance off at a lower rate.”\\n\\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nBut if you have card debt and still have a very good credit score, it’s better to \\\\[do a normal\\\\] balance transfer and get a 0% rate for a period of time.\\n\\n— Beverly Harzog, Consumer Finance Analyst\\n\\n## Does Aven offer a competitive rewards program?\\n\\nThe short answer is that Aven does offer competitive rebates, but it’s not the “best of breed” when compared to other cash-back offers. If you really like the 2% unlimited cash back benefit on all purchases, you should be aware that there are “normal” rebate cards that offer [2% cash back on purchases (or more) with no annual fees](https://www.cardratings.com/best-credit-cards-for-cash-back-rewards.html#card3387).\\n\\nIf you are trying to pay down debt, that extra .5% (or more) on some purchases could help you out.\\n\\n“Paying down debt could make my earnings go further rather than just using my cash back to buy stuff off Amazon like I’ve done in the past,” notes Scott Bonge, the founder of\\xa0[MyPerfectGoatee.com](https://www.myperfectgoatee.com/), and a long-term rewards credit card user.\\n\\n“It’s really a matter of personal preference, money-management style and existing credit resources,” Khalfani-Cox adds. “Someone who doesn’t need a HELOC, perhaps because they already have one or don’t want to draw down on that line, may be better off with a traditional 2% cash back card.\\n\\n“But for someone who prefers lower rates (ongoing, not intro.) and/or having the flexibility that a HELOC-type card provides, the Aven card may be more beneficial.”\\n\\nThe bottom line is that while Aven has a decent rewards program, you shouldn’t apply for this offer solely based on it’s rewards program. The rebates should be viewed simply as an added bonus (pun intended).\\n\\n> BONUS TIP!\\n>\\n> As is the case with other reward cards, you can not earn rebates on balance transfers and cash outs. The redemption options for Aven are limited as cash-back rebates are only redeemable as a statement credit (you can’t get gift cards, a check in the mail, etc).\\n\\n## Final thoughts\\n\\nThe Aven Home card has introduced a creative way for homeowners to conveniently take advantage of their equity. I love their hybrid approach and I do believe this offer can definitely be a blessing to a certain demographic, particularly when considering the economic environment we find ourselves in.\\n\\nI also love the balance transfer and cash out feature, but would caution current and potential cardholders to remember a few “old school” debt reduction principles when using this new card to consolidate and/or pay down debt.\\n\\n“In general, I recommend people prioritize paying off their debts organically — meaning they use cash to pay it off, not another form of borrowing,” Khalfani-Cox elaborates. “There’s a difference between a ‘zero debt'”‘ strategy — which seeks to eliminate debt progressively — and a ‘shift debt’ strategy, which really just pushes the debt around from one form of credit or borrowing to another.\\n\\n_“_ Because I once had a ton of credit card debt before paying it off, I do understand the ‘shift debt’ strategy,” Khalfani-Cox conitinues. “It’s the same strategy, in effect, that people have used (myself included) when they do balance transfers. You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a ‘shift debt’ strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it’s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt. Ultimately, you do have to pay the piper and pay off what you owe.”\\n\\nUltimately, as Khalfani-Cox reminded me in a recent interview, it pays to have a set of rules for when you will use credit. Ask yourself: under what circumstances and for what types of purchases will I use this card or this form of credit — and then stick to that. By setting up some pre-established guidelines and criteria for credit usage, you’ll become a lot better at managing credit wisely and avoiding the pitfall of excessive credit use.\\n\\nI sincerely hope these insider tips are helpful to you and would love your feedback on your personal experiences with the Aven card, balance transfers and card debt. Who knows, I may include feedback from you in a future article.

Part [secured card](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/secured-credit-cards-vs-unsecured-difference), part [home equity line of credit](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/heloc-home-equity-line-of-credit) (HELOC), part cash-back card, the Aven credit card is nothing if not unique.\\n\\nIssued by Coastal Community Bank, the Aven card joins a growing list of cards that are secured by something other than cash. But while other alternative cards are secured by [jewelry](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/pesto-credit-card) or a [vehicle](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/yendo-credit-card), the Aven credit card is backed by home equity, which raises the possibility of losing your house if you default. That’s a risk many consumers won’t want to take.\\n\\nHere’s what you need to know about the Aven Home Equity Credit Card.\\n\\n🤓Nerdy Tip\\n\\nAs of this writing, the Aven card is only available in 31 states. Furthermore, customers in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Wyoming are eligible for up to a $100,000 credit line on the Aven credit card. For everyone else, the maximum credit limit is $250,000. See our primer for more information about [Coastal Community Bank](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/what-is-coastal-community-bank).\\n\\n» MORE: [Should you use your home or car as collateral for a credit card?](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/should-you-use-your-home-or-car-as-collateral-for-a-credit-card)\\n\\n## 1\\\\. Your home is the collateral backing the credit card\\n\\nThe Aven credit card is secured by your home; as such, owning a home is necessary to qualify for the Aven card. You must also have equity in that home, meaning that the value of the property is greater than what is owed on the mortgage. Aven says the company uses automatic valuation models to prove the value of your home, whereas a traditional HELOC generally requires an appraisal. The minimum credit line on the Aven card is $7,000.\\n\\nAdditional requirements include a minimum FICO score of 640, which is considered [fair credit](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/fair-credit-score-good-credit), and proof of income. Applicants’ income may be verified by tax documents, pay stubs and instant bank account verification, among other methods. Aven CEO Sadi Khan said in an email that income \"is one of the most important variables” the company uses to determine eligibility for the Aven card. “We want to ensure they will have the ability to pay; we are not interested in cardholders defaulting,” he said.\\n\\n[Defaulting](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/credit-card-default-what-to-do), or failing to make a credit card payment for more than 180 days, is always a serious matter, but perhaps even more so when it comes to the Aven card. Because the card is backed by your home equity, you could lose your house as a consequence of defaulting. Khan said that foreclosure is a last resort that Aven takes only after the cardholder has been through the delinquency management process for five to six months.\\n\\n» MORE: [What to do if you\\'re delinquent on a credit card payment](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/delinquent-credit-card-payment)\\n\\nTrying to get approved for a card?\\n\\nCreate a NerdWallet account for insight on your credit score and personalized recommendations for the right card for you.\\n\\n[GET STARTED](https://www.nerdwallet.com/api/nts/v1/login?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nerdwallet.com%2Fhome%2Fdashboard&driverPageName=5_things_to_know_about_the_aven_credit_card&driverLocation=AuthLink&driverSubLocation=&driverElement=button&deployableName=article-client&deployableVersion=1.1.1279&driverPageUrl=&driverPageViewId=477ce730-71f6-4fa5-952b-53db6c5d14f4&driverContentId=1436641&driverContentSource=wp&driverFlowName=&anonymousUserId=&initialScreen=signup)\\n\\n## 2\\\\. The card is an alternative to a HELOC, for better and worse\\n\\nThe Aven card styles itself as a cross between a HELOC and a traditional credit card. Its hybrid nature comes with benefits and drawbacks. Like a primary mortgage, taking out a HELOC often incurs closing costs that may include an origination fee and home appraisal fee, among others. The $0-annual-fee Aven card, however, doesn’t charge fees to let you tap into your home’s equity.\\n\\nBut hitching the value of your home to a credit card could be a slippery slope into financial ruin.\\n\\n[Studies show](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/credit-cards-make-you-spend-more) that you\\'re more likely to spend more with a credit card than with cash. It can be too tempting to spend your home’s equity when it’s linked to a credit card, a payment method that plenty of people use on a daily basis. The Aven card’s rewards rate (more on that later) further incentivizes consumers to use the card regularly. Using a HELOC to pay for frivolous expenses that would normally break the budget can put your homeownership in jeopardy.\\n\\nYes, credit card rewards are a nice perk, but they’re nowhere near as valuable as the roof over your head.\\n\\n» SEE: [Good reasons to get a HELOC](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/home-equity-line-credit-heloc-reasons)\\n\\n🤓Nerdy Tip\\n\\nIf you want a HELOC but also the convenience of paying with plastic, the Aven card isn’t the only option. Many traditional HELOC accounts come with a card that can be used to make purchases or withdraw cash, much like a debit card, though you won\\'t earn rewards.\\n\\n## 3\\\\. The rewards rate is high\\n\\nAll purchases made with the Aven credit card earn an unlimited [2% cash back](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/2-percent-cash-back), an excellent flat rate. Cash back is earned as points that can only be redeemed for a statement credit. The statement credit counts as a payment toward the statement balance and minimum payment due. That’s a major departure from other credit cards that don’t consider a statement credit an official payment.\\n\\nPoints earned with the Aven credit card never expire.\\n» BEST: [Rewards credit cards right now](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/rewards)\\n\\n## 4\\\\. Interest rates are lower than the industry average\\n\\nInterest rates on the Aven credit card are significantly lower than what you’d find in other cards. As of May 2023, the average [credit card annual percentage rate](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/what-is-purchase-apr) for cards that charged interest was 20.68%. On the Aven card, interest rates range from 7.99%-15.49%, depending on creditworthiness (as of October 2023). Furthermore, Aven caps APRs at 18% for all cardholders, even if the prime interest rate goes higher.\\n\\nNew cardholders can lower their APR by another 0.25% by enrolling in auto pay.\\n\\nOf course, you’ll never owe interest if you pay off your credit card balances in full every month.\\n\\n» LEARN: [How to avoid credit card interest — or at least reduce it](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/how-to-avoid-credit-card-interest)\\n\\n## 5\\\\. Balance transfers are possible —\\xa0but not advisable — with the Aven credit card\\n\\nThe Aven card may be used for balance transfers, but think carefully about consolidating debt with this particular card.\\n\\nAt first blush, the Aven card seems to be a good option for moving debt thanks to its relatively low interest rates and 2.5% [balance transfer fee](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/what-is-a-balance-transfer-fee-on-a-credit-card). Other credit cards tend to charge at least 3% to move debt.\\n\\n[![Citibank Diamond Preferred Credit Card](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1800,quality=85/cdn/images/marketplace/credit_cards/cb1d60ff-bf72-4b4e-b702-2aa42ba59d40/733a19f3cd2a42d851b2e863b33b2fd2f0d30dcec8cbe635e5509506632f4e56.jpg)](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/credit-cards/citi-diamond-preferred?trk=cc_lm&trk_channel=web&trk_element=image&trk_location=MiniProductCard)\\n\\n[NerdWallet rating](https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/Citibank-Diamond-Preferred-Mastercard?trk_channel=web&trk_element=hyperlink&trk_location=marketplace-star-rating&trk_pagetype&trk_sectionCategory)\\nNerdWallet\\'s ratings are determined by our editorial team.

The [best balance transfer cards](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/balance-transfer), such as the [Citi® Diamond Preferred® Card](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/credit-cards/citi-diamond-preferred), charge exactly 0% interest on balance transfers for up to 21 months.\\n\\nThen there’s the matter of turning [unsecured debt](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/personal-loans/secured-vs-unsecured-loans) into debt secured by your home. When you default on unsecured debt, your credit score will probably suffer, and the creditor could garnish your wages or take you to court to recoup missing funds. Those are terrible consequences, yes, but when you default on secured debt, the lender can seize whatever asset is backing the loan, which in the case of the Aven card is your home.\\n\\nFor a cheaper and less risky balance transfer option, consider a balance transfer credit card.\\n\\n» NEXT: [Top secured credit cards](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/secured)\\n\\nNo Annual Fee, Rich Intro Offer!\\n\\nChase Freedom Unlimited®\\n\\nCash back\\n\\nDining\\n\\n![Chase Freedom Unlimited Credit Card](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1800,quality=85/cdn/images/marketplace/credit_cards/84e1494c-bae2-4b0d-ac8d-e8c095ceb2fe/3a0cac78e497688cdc58fb030fd6c59eea6a6275256e6a523d7999e1827ffd06.jpg)\\n\\n[NerdWallet Rating](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/credit-cards/chase-freedom-unlimited) NerdWallet\\'s ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven\\'s control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\\n\\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven\\'s bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant\\'s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\\n\\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans.

There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\\n\\n\\n##### Payments\\n\\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\\n\\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan\\'s minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\\n\\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\\n\\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\\n\\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\\n\\n\\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\\n\\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\\n\\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\\n\\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\\n\\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\\xa0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\\n\\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection.

In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower’s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\\n\\n\\n\\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\\n\\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nIn order to qualify, you must:\\n\\n\\n- Be under 70 years old\\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\\n- Not be self-employed\\n\\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss.

The 3% cash back is obviously interesting, I suspect you might also be able to get large credit limits as it’s tied to your home equity. This could help boost your FICO score.

The [Aven Visa Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) is an innovative financial solution that rewards you with a lower cost of capital for having built equity in your home.\\n\\nThis card can be right for homeowners with some borrowing or spending needs. It isn\\'t for everyone, but if used correctly, it can potentially make sense for you.\\n\\n## What is the Aven Home Credit Card?\\n\\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)\\n\\nAVEN\\n\\nThe [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) combines a credit card and a home equity line of credit, or HELOC. It uses the equity in your home to give you a flexible credit line for purchases. Not to mention, it comes with low variable interest rates starting at 7.49%.\\\\* Plus, the card starts at a $0 fee to get the card\\\\*. That includes no origination fee, no annual fee and no appraisal, notary or prepayment penalty fees, though a county recording fee may apply.\\\\*\\n\\nIt is a rewards card that earns you 2% unlimited cash back on every transaction you make with the card and 7% cash back on all hotel bookings through the Aven Travel Portal.\\\\* Aven states that you\\'ll find all the same hotels and airlines available on other online travel agencies, including Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and other luxury chains.\\n\\nAven says that it approves new customers quickly with lines up to $250,000 with flexible repayment options. Borrowers can also request cash advances or balance transfers, though a 2.5% fee\\\\* on these types of transactions should factor into your decision-making.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that this sort of approach to leveraging the equity in your home does have some risks and drawbacks.\\n\\nThe variable APR and the 2.5% fee on cash out and balance transfers\\\\* could impact your total cost of credit. Aven does offer fixed APR plans for cashouts and balance transfers as well with 5-year or 10-year term options.\\\\* HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) carry the risk of a lien on your home but lower your interest burden, whereas personal credit cards generally won\\'t result in foreclosure on your home if you\\'re unable to pay your debt but carry much higher interest rates that might result in bankruptcy. Aven is aware of people\\'s potential concerns about foreclosure and recently introduced a guaranteed foreclosure protection program for eligible cardholders.\\\\*\\n\\n## Easy application process, quick approval\\n\\nWhere Aven truly shines over traditional HELOC processes is the ease of applying and the time it takes to approve and open your account. Customers can get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\\n\\nThis card is a home equity line of credit, even if it functions similarly to a credit card. That means you\\'ll need to own a home and have the title in your name. You\\'ll also need a credit score of at least 640, a combined loan-to-value ratio of under 89% (inclusive of the Aven line), and sufficient income to repay the loan.\\n\\n![](https://thepointsguy.com/images/EmailSignUp/daily-dt.svg)\\n\\nDaily Newsletter\\n\\nReward your inbox with the TPG Daily newsletter\\n\\nJoin over 700,000 readers for breaking news, in-depth guides and exclusive deals from TPG’s experts\\n\\nEmail address\\n\\nSign up\\n\\nBy signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our [Terms of Use](https://thepointsguy.com/terms-of-use/) and acknowledge the data practices in our [Privacy Policy](https://thepointsguy.com/privacy-policy/).

(Each borrower should consult a tax professional to understand their individual tax circumstances.)\\n\\n### Cons\\n\\n- A larger line of credit may lead to overspending on purchases. Aven does verify income levels to ensure borrowers can afford payments.\\n- Any line of credit secured by your home opens you up to the risk of foreclosure. Aven says that it works with borrowers to minimize this risk. Aven also offers optional debt protection plans in partnership with Securian Financial, at no profit to Aven, that protect enrolled borrowers for up to $50,000 of outstanding balances in the event of involuntary job loss. However, traditional personal credit cards don\\'t generally result in defaults on your primary home, even if you end up in a situation where you cannot keep up with the amount owed, but can lead to other challenges with higher interest rates (bankruptcy, etc.).\\n- There\\'s a 2.5% fee for cash transfer and balance transfer options\\\\*, which can add to your cost of credit in a meaningful way.\\n- If the value of your home falls, it\\'s possible that you could owe more than your home is worth. That could create problems if you try to sell your home in the future.\\n\\n## Bottom line\\n\\nThe [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) represents a unique way to leverage the equity in your home to finance major purchases such as home renovations, medical, major purchases, and education expenses. With a quick and easy application process, Aven can make it easier to have a credit line available for large purchases that you want to pay for over time. And Aven\\'s rates can be much lower than traditional credit card rates if you intend to carry a balance.\\n\\nHowever, there are unique risks and things to consider with a HELOC vs. a traditional credit card, so weigh the pros and cons accordingly.\\n\\nIt\\'s wise to consider whether a credit line that\\'s backed by the equity in your home is the right choice for your financial needs. If you determine the Aven Home Card is the right choice for you, the [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D) is certainly an interesting option to consider.\\n\\n**Learn more: [Aven Home Credit Card](https://www.aven.com/?utm_source=thepointsguy&utm_campaign=article&utm_id=%7Bca_clickid%7D)**\\n\\n_\\\\*For full terms and conditions, visit [aven.com](http://www.aven.com/#disclosures)._\\n\\n_Aven cards are arranged by Aven Financial, Inc., dba \"Aven\" or \"AvenCard\" (in AR, ID, and PA).

The company was established by Sadi Khan, Collin Wikman and Murtada Shah, the former product, design and engineering executives at Facebook and Square.\\n\\nIndeed, it was only in 2022 that Aven first launched, further highlighting the rapidity of its impressive growth. Today, Aven is on a mission to provide its consumers with the lowest costs and most convenient access to capital.\\n\\nIts first product, Aven Home Card, enables homeowners to access their home equity in a matter of minutes – beginning at $0 to get – maintaining all the benefits of a traditional credit card.\\n\\nIn the two years post-launch, Aven has issued over US$1.5bn in credit lines for its Home Card, saving customers over US$100m in interest payments to date.\\n\\nSadi Khan, Co-founder and CEO of Aven, says: \"We believe there\\'s no reason for anyone who owns an asset and has a good credit history to use unsecured credit. Full stop. Unsecured credit is expensive and unhealthy.\\n\\n“With our asset-backed credit cards, we give consumers credit for what they own - saving them thousands of dollars without sacrificing convenience.”\\n\\n## Aven: Broadening its product offering\\n\\nAmid its successful growth, Aven has launched a series of new financial products to match. After growing its revenue three-fold in 2023, the fintech startup launched a free, mobile-first financial advisory tool – Aven Advisor. Today, the tool has over 160,000 members.\\n\\nWith its latest investment, Aven plans to offer Aven Home Card in all 50 US States, scale its advisory tool and expand into new verticals including auto-backed cards and mortgage refinancing.\\n\\nVinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures adds: “By using technology to drive efficiency, Aven has built a product that responsibly helps drive down the cost of capital by over 50% for most US homeowners who are using alternative credit cards.”\\n\\nAven is also announcing the formation of an advisory board, focused on helping it scale while protecting the interests of its cardholders and offering insights on industry conditions and strategic opportunities.\\n\\nThe Aven Advisory Board will be made up of four executives: Michael DeVito, former CEO of Freddie Mac; Tim Mayopoulos, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jim Messina, former Deputy Chief of Staff to the White House under the Obama administration; and Kevin Warsh, former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\\n\\nNew board member Kevin Warsh adds: “I was blown away by the Aven team when I first met them several years ago. However, I was initially sceptical that their core product would scale in the staid, calcified industry structure that has prevailed in the mortgage market for decades. The Aven team is proving the sceptics wrong in a big way. I am thrilled to be their partner.”\\n\\nAven is currently available in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and\\xa0 Wyoming.\\n\\nFor more venture capital news in the fintech space, follow the link [here](https://fintechmagazine.com/venture-capital).

APR \\n Cash Out (draw to bank account) fee and Balance Transfer fee is 2.5% of amount transferred \\n \\n \\n Our Verdict \\n It does say you can check your offer without a credit check so they must be doing a soft pull on your credit and then a hard pull if you go ahead and apply for the product. The 3% cash back is obviously interesting, I suspect you might also be able to get large credit limits as it’s tied to your home equity. This could help boost your FICO score. Could also be useful as a HELOC alternative. Some users are already familiar with Aven due to the $5 weekly gift card offer for those with high credit scores. \\n Hat tip to reader Tony Q \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n You may also like'),\n",

In short:\\n>\\n> - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower’s home – your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable.\\n> - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you’ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events – like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option.'),\n",

You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a ‘shift debt’ strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it’s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt.

If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.'),\n",

In short:\\n>\\n> - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower’s home – your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable.\\n> - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you’ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events – like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option.'),\n",

You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a ‘shift debt’ strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it’s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt.

The 3% cash back is obviously interesting, I suspect you might also be able to get large credit limits as it’s tied to your home equity. This could help boost your FICO score. Could also be useful as a HELOC alternative.
